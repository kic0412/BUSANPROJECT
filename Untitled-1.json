                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Houses are packed on the midslope of the mountains surrounding Busanhang Port.\nRefugees who left their hometowns to come to Busan climbed up the mountains to build the villages. As long as there was work, people would go up and down 168 Stairs multiple times a day to the dock, station, and Gukje Market.\nLet’s go see Choryang Ibagu-gil, a storytelling path narrated by people who did not even speak the Gyeongsang-do Province dialect. \n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Choryang Ibagu-gil</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Former Baekje Hospital - Namseon Warehouse Site – Choryang Church - 168 Stairs - Kim Min-bu Observatory - Ebagu Archive Center - Chang Kee-ryo Memorial Hall - Yoo Chi-hwan Postbox Observatory</p>\nAs soon as you leave Busan Station, you will learn the special story of Busan. The starting point of Choryang Ibagu-gil—the magnificent former Baekje Hospital and redbrick Namseon Warehouse Site at the narrow alley across the Busan Station building, where only the walls remain—clearly reveal the passage of time. The two most brilliant buildings of the 1920s bring people back in time to imagine their former glory.\n\n\n\nLet’s visit the Choryang Church built by foreign missionaries. This was a gathering place for those who opposed paying tributes to the shrines and carried out anti-Japanese movements. The narrow alley trail along the walls of Choryang Elementary School reveals the passage of time. Photos show the joys and sorrows of the refugees.\n\n\n\nThere’s no way that the Kkakkomak Shanty Town, which did not even have a road, was equipped with a water supply. Residents had to climb up and down the 168 Stairs to draw water from the well. Now, only the well site remains. The monorail next to the staircase gives visitors a sense of how much time has passed by.\n\n\n\nCatch your breath at the Kim Minbu Viewing Point, and head over to the Ebagu Archive Center. The Ebagu Archive Center is an exhibition space that displays little stories on the mountainside road of Choryang. The mountainside town, looking like it would touch the sky, is full of households that have tons of interesting stories to tell. It is a place that narrates the difficulties of life without exaggeration.\n\n\n\nDoctor Chang Kee-ryo was a surgeon who treated poor refugees for free without a place that he could call home for his entire life. Learn the beauty of voluntary poverty at the Chang Kee-ryo Memorial Hall “The Nanum,” where Doctor Chang’s noble medical endeavors are celebrated. At the Yoo Chihwan Postbox Observatory located at the end of the mountainside road where the village bus wraps up the journey on Choryang Ibagu-gil, you can see the Busanhang Port.\n\nHave your own chat at the historic alley. While following the stories, you will learn that “Ibagu” is a dialect that means “story,” and that “ Kkakkomak,” means “a difficult path to hike the hill.”\nChoryang Ibagu-gil is a journey that continues for us as it did for the refugees.\n\n\n"

If you want to enjoy the unique charm of Busan’s sea, try the Jeoryeong Coastal Trail!\nJeoryeong Coastal Trail, located at the entrance of Taejongdae Park in Yeongseon-dong, Yeongdo-gu, Busan, is a three-kilometer coastal trail that departs at the management office of Namhang-dong and passes through Jungnihang Port and Gamji Coastal Trail up to the Taejongdae Park. \nThe place used to be a military-protected area because of its steep and perilous topography. Since 2001, it was renovated into a walking trail and is now established as a national tourist attraction. The tile mural paintings that are formed along the walls of the walking trail and the wave-patterned flooring are in harmony with the view of the ocean, adding coolness to the scenery.\nWalking along the Jeoryeong Coastal Trail, you’ll see female divers from the Namhang Village Group who are harvesting seafood. The cozy Women Diver Village located right after the Huin-yeoul Coastal Tunnel  is where you’ll see raw seafood caught from the ocean. You can walk along the trail and stop by the village to enjoy a meal with the fresh flavors of the ocean.\nSelected as one of the five coastal trails of Korea designated by the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs in 2014, the trail offers more. You can climb up the rainbow-colored piano steps to reach the Huinnyeoul Observatory  where you can see the dreamy seascape of the Namhang anchoring basin. Alternatively, you can go directly to the Huin-yeoul Coastal Tunnel that measures 70 m long and is full of colorful lighting and brilliant photozones for tourists to enjoy. \nGet off the Huin-yeoul Coastal Tunnel and come across an entirely different coastal road. The West Coast Trail of Yeongdo is well preserved in its natural setting. Watching the vertical precipice and sound of waves crash against the rock will relieve your stress and worries. Moreover, the suspension bridge that connects rocks is a fun structure to cross on the long walking trail.\nWalk through the forest path to get to the Jeoryeong Haeranggil Trail, which features several viewing spots with access to the open sea. Along them, the Haneul Observatory Skywalk will make you feel a dizzying but powerful sensation like you are walking on the ocean. There is also 75 Plaza, formed in 1975, which is a place where tourists can rest and a hot culture spot where you can see as far as Tsushima Island on a clear day. The horizon is on one side, and the Huinnyeoul Village is on the other. The relaxing breeze from the ocean will sweep away your hardships and sadness.\nWalking along the dynamic waves of the Jeoryeong Coastal Trail will allow you to experience freedom and relaxation. This magnificent natural landscape is a precious treasure of Yeongdo.\n\n\n"

In addition, the vast sea and the foam that splashes against the coastal cliff under the glass floor are blue and breathtaking.\n\nSongdo Cloud Trails\nThe Cloud Trails at the Songdo Beach—the first public beach in Korea—is the largest Skywalk in Busan. The views of the Songdo Sea seen from the cloud trail is captivating as large ships float on the ocean far away like specks and colorful cable cars go up and down. The walking trail that connects in straight and curvy sections is surrounded by the ocean, making it feel like you’re walking on the sea.\n\nCheongsapo Daritdol Observatory\nCheongsapo Daritdol Observatory was made in the shape of a unique curve to represent the blue dragon that symbolizes the village. The Daritdol, named after the five rocks lined up from the Cheongsapo Coast to the marine lighthouse, appears like a stepping-stone bridge.\nExperience the thrill of walking on the sea through the transparent floor. Visitors will wear shoe covers at the entrance of the information center to protect the glass floor. The telescope at the end of the observatory allows a closer look at the landscape.\n\n\n"

Thanks to the rising level, Haeundae Beach, Dongbaekseom Island, and Gwangandaegyo Bridge come into view simultaneously. The beautiful cafés and romantic restaurants located along the stone wall path make visitors’ hearts flutter with anticipation.\nHaewoljeong Pavilion waits at the midpoint of Dalmajigil Road.

You can start walking on the forest path at the entrance of the Moontan Road at the beginning of Dalmaji Hill, but if you already reached Haewoljeong Pavilion, this path is the fastest way to go to Moontan Road.\nWear a casual outfit and sneakers to stroll along the Moontan Road a forest path under the moonlight, connected to a well-organized walking trail at the beginning of Dalmaji Hill.

Should you choose to continue walking on the Donghae Nambu Line instead of returning to the starting point, you will reach the Cheongsapo Port and Songjeong Beach. Lights are turned on between sunset and 11:00 p.m. as well as from 05:00 a.m. until sunset.\nAnother great charm of the Moontan Road is that even though you are walking on a forest path, you can view the blue ocean endlessly stretching from one side to the other. Pass by the observatory spots scattered around the trail to view the ocean of Busan and relieve all accumulated stress. Listen to the waves, and close your eyes to remove complicated thoughts that clutter your mind.\n\nA slow walk under the moonlight as the ocean breeze blows through the fragrance of the pine.\nWalk away from the urban scene of Haeundae, and discover the hidden charms of the region.\n\n\n"

Formerly an island, the coastal trail is now connected to the land through years of sedimentation. The people of Busan, however, still refer to the place as Dongbaekseom Island.\nDongbaek Park, built with the natural elements of the area still intact, is a beautiful place with a dense habitation of black pine. The 950 m long coastal trail formed around Dongbaekseom Island is just enough to take a leisurely stroll and organize the day’s work.\nWalk a bit longer past the first observatory deck to see a lone rock statue. The Mermaid Statue was sculpted based on the myth of Princess Hwangok recorded in Samguk yusa (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms). Princess Hwangok, who married into a family that lived far away, consoled her longing for her homeland by looking out into the night sea when the full moon illuminated the ocean.\nFirst installed in 1974, the statue was damaged in the 1987 typhoon. With the statue’s remaining upper body stored at the Busan Museum, the statue currently on view at Dongbaekseom Island was newly sculpted in 1989.\nWalk along the connecting sea path to reach the Suspension Bridge. On parts of the bridge, you can see the ocean below. The bridge, however, is fairly short and installed on a moderately high location, which means that even those with fear of heights, including children, may safely cross.\nThe coastal trail connects to a white lighthouse and a wide observatory, where you can look out into the ocean to see the Nurimaru APEC House and Gwangandaegyo Bridge. Turn your gaze a bit to the left to see the Oryukdo Islets. This is a great spot to view the sea of Busan all at once.\nThe Nurimaru APEC House hosted the Busan APEC Summit in 2005. At the main meeting room, the circular formation of the chairs of Asian and Pacific leaders who attended the summit are on display alongside the meals and gifts provided during the event. The modern exterior perfectly harmonizes with the magnificent view of Haeundae, making the venue a unique international meeting place.\nAt Dongbaekseom Island, you can experience the ocean, forest, and nature in their natural state. Walk along the coastline, and view the symbolic architecture that represents Busan. The Dongbaek Coastal Trail is a must-visit destination during your trip to Haeundae.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "On June 25, 1950, the Korean War began with a surprise attack on neighboring South Korea at dawn. Unprepared to fight, South Korea lost its capital, Seoul, in three days after the war broke out. The South Korean government had no option but to retreat and declared Busan as the wartime capital on August 18, 1950. Although it has been almost 70 years since then, Busan still has traces of the war. Let us follow these historical traces filled with joys and sorrows.\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Wartime Capital Trail</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Tombstone Cultural Village - Cloud Observatory – Choi Min-Shik Gallery – Train House Artistic Cultural Experience Ground - Provisional Capital Memorial Hall – Seokdang Museum</p>\nIn Ami-dong, Seo-gu, Busan, there is Tombstone Culture Village, where you can have a glimpse of the kind of life that refugees experienced. Away from the war, many Koreans fled to Busan without a plan and settled down at the foot of a mountain, with a cemetery built by Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Korea. At that time, it was difficult to build a house because there were hardly any materials. Nevertheless, as a way to stay out of the wind and rain, they built shelters on top of the tombstones in the cemetery. You can still find traces at the alleys in Tombstone Culture Village.\n\n\n\nIn a 3 min walking distance from Tombstone Culture Village, you can reach the “Cloud Observatory” with a panoramic view of mountainside road across Ami-dong. Refugees from the Korean War built their homes on hillsides, despite not owning any lands. As you observe the houses standing side by side along the alleys that are too narrow, even for one person to pass through, you will see and feel the broken and exhausted faces of the refugees.\n\n\n\nIn a town located right below the observatory, Choi Min-Shik Gallery, one of the must-visit places, vividly portrays the lives of the refugees. Choi Min-Shik is a first-generation Korean documentary photographer based in Busan, particularly known for taking photographs of people going about their daily lives. In this gallery, you can find various post-war Busan photos, including a woman selling goods at Jagalchi Market and a child with a bright smile on his sooty face. These old photos will let you see and reflect the hardship that the refugees underwent to survive, as they hold on to a dim light of hope, despite feeling exhausted and shattered by the event.\n\n\n\nLocated next to Choi Min-Shik Gallery, Train House Artistic Cultural Experience Ground is also a must-visit place. The words “Train House” came from several people who lived in a small room after dividing into many sections similar to train couches. This place signifies the poor conditions that the refugees from the Korean War had to endure to survive. Currently, it is used as an experience center and a resting area for local residents and tourists. \n\n\n\nThe Provisional Capital Memorial Hall is a 10 min walk along the ridge from Train House Artistic Cultural Experience Ground. It was formerly used as a presidential residence for about 1,000 days, while Busan was the wartime capital. Furthermore, it was where Rhee Syngman attended to the affairs of state. There is also an exhibition hall with an extensive collection of replicas that invites visitors, including children, to show the lives of the refugees during the Korean War.\n\n\n\nAs you walk from the Provisional Capital Memorial Hall to Dong-A University, you will find the Seokdang Museum. Originally used as the Temporary Capital Government Building for the wartime capital, it is now transformed into a museum that outlines Busan’s history. Widely known as Busan’s most famous modern building with red bricks and giwa roof tiles, it has great historical significance because it shows modern and contemporary Korean politics and society—from the Japanese occupation to the Korean War.\n\n\n\nEnjoying Busan’s blue ocean and skyscraper is a great way to travel around Busan. Nevertheless, if you are interested in learning about Busan’s history, which is closely linked to the modern and contemporary history of Korea, then visit and walk along the Korean War Heritage Trail.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Singer Kang Daniel made his debut in Produce 101 Season 2.\nHis popularity attracts his fans from all over the world to his hometown, Busan.\nBusan is in the spotlight, thanks to the Kang Daniel tour.\nPlaces all over Busan that his breath has touched have already been famous as a pilgrimage.\nFrom his alma mater in Yeongdo, where he was born, to Busan’s famous attractions and restaurants,\nlet us jump into the Kang Daniel tour that satisfies both the hearts of his fans and allow them to go sightseeing at once.\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Kang Daniel Tour Course</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Yeongdodaegyo Bridge - Shinseon Middle School  – Daltteune - Huinnyeoul Culture Village - Taejongdae Park</p>\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Yeongdodaegyo Bridge</p>The first spot to visit is Yeongdodaegyo Bridge—the only bascule bridge in Korea. It is no wonder that a trip to Yeongdo begins with Yeongdodaegyo Bridge. If you’re from Busan, you may know its symbolism. Kang Daniel must have also crossed this bridge, more times than he could count, with his family and friends. Yeongdodaegyo Bridge, which has connected Yeongdo to its mainland for ages, is open for 15 min at 2:00 p.m. Every day, people flock to see the bridge deck lifted toward the sky. If you want to see how the bridge works, you should watch it from Nampo-dong.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Shinseon Middle School</p>If you enter Yeongdo, take a bus to visit Shinseon Middle School. It is Kang Daniel’s alma mater, where he spent three years studying in Yeongdo—from the alleys, which he walked to school every morning to the playground, even to old school desks and chairs that he might have used. Some of his fans must feel excited just by imagining his school days while watching all the stuff he touched. Moreover, the blue oceanic view from the school is a bonus. To avoid interrupting students’ learning, you should observe silence.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">A sliced raw mackerel restaurant</p>You can’t miss the restaurant that specializes in sliced raw mackerel after visiting Shinseon Middle School, as it was where Kang Daniel first drank with his teacher.\nTheir tangy mackerel salad and seafood are beyond comparison. Thus, this restaurant may be small but feels big enough to create a cozy and friendly retro atmosphere.\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Huinnyeoul Culture Village</p>Huinnyeoul Culture Village is one of the attractions in Yeongdo that you shouldn’t miss. Known as Santorini in Korea, it was reborn by the local artists and residents who joined in renovating this old neighborhood. Filled with beautifully crafted murals together with a clear view of the sea, this place is perfect for taking the best shot in your life. In addition, the idyllic landscape of the fishing village will leave you breathless, as you walk along the narrow alleys in the village, facing the sea as its yard.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Taejongdae Park</p>Taejongdae Park has been a representative recreation area of Yeongdo since ancient times. Those who grew up in Yeongdo would always go on a picnic to the park as a schoolchild. Imagine Kang Daniel playing and jumping around on a picnic. Can you picture it? It takes more than an hour to look around Taejongdae Park on foot while appreciating a vast expanse of sea and the mysteries of unique rock formation. If walking is a little difficult, you can take the slow train called Danubi Train.\nStarting with Yeongdodaegyo Bridge, the Kang Daniel tour course ends with a visit to Taejongdae Park. From the alleys along which Kang Daniel dreamed of being a singer as a child to its famous destinations, Yeongdo takes pride in rich and diverse views that fully deserve your attention for one day.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Let’s see the spots where cherry blossoms bloom first in Korea, except Jeju Island, and\nwhere you can enjoy them along the streets of every city or out of town\nwhile appreciating mountains, rivers, and the sea.\nCome and feel the spring of Busan.\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Daejeo Eco Park</p>Daejeo Eco Park is the largest canola flower field in South Korea. It provides various sports facilities, so you can enjoy and relax during your free time. When canola flowers fall, cherry blossoms begin to bloom, creating a spectacular view of pink and yellow waves. At the end of March, cherry blossom festivals take place in the Nakdonggang Riverside Samsimni in Gangseo. The vast riverside of the Nakdonggang River reaches its peak of spring filled with splendid white cherry blossoms.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Samnak Eco Park</p>Samnak Eco Park is famous as a bird sanctuary for migrating species. It consists of wildflower gardens, bicycle paths, walking trails, and auto campgrounds. Particularly in spring, more than 3,000 cherry trees planted along the Nakdonggang Riverside create a white flower tunnel. When the sun sets and the lights are turned on, the park creates a romantic atmosphere. Thus, Samnak Eco Park’s name has never been removed from the list as one of the best cherry blossom attractions in Busan.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Maekdo Eco Park</p>Habitat for migratory birds in winter, Maekdo Eco Park is loved by citizens in all seasons because of its trails, wetland decks, lotus colony, aquatic botanical garden, and sports facilities. This park is relatively less known to people among the cherry blossom attractions in Busan, allowing you to appreciate spring without having to rush the experience. Above all, Maekdo Eco Park, with no stalls, is a perfect spot for those who want to enjoy the cherry blossoms in a quiet and relaxing atmosphere.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Haeundae Dalmajigil Road</p>As one of the best driving roads in Busan, Dalmajigil Road in Haeundae is lined up with diverse restaurants and cafés, loved by couples. The dreamy harmony of the moonlight and the cherry blossoms create an unforgettable beauty, especially in the evening when cherry blossoms are in full bloom beneath a full moon. As you stroll along the hillside road, you’ll be awestruck at the marvelous scene of cherry blossoms in the moonlight.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Namcheon-dong Cherry Blossom Street</p>Namcheon-dong is one of the representative cherry blossom habitats in Busan, while Namcheon-dong Cherry Blossom Street is popular among foreign tourists. On the other hand, the street from Samick Beach Apartment to Gwangalli Beach is a hidden spot where you can enjoy cherry blossoms. In spring, you can easily find people who drive in the apartment complex or create memories under the cherry blossoms. During the cherry blossom season, make sure to observe silence for the residents living nearby.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Dongdaesin-dong Cherry Blossom Street</p>Another cherry blossom attraction that even Busan citizens are not aware of is the cherry blossom tunnel in Samik Apartment, Dongdaesin-dong.\nEvery spring, pink cherry blossoms bloom beautifully between the houses and in the apartment complex. Although it’s not yet well known to people yet, you can enjoy a quieter spring here than other crowded, famous cherry blossom roads. Cherry blossoms in full bloom under the streetlights are fascinating, so why not stop by on your way home from work?\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Oncheoncheon Café Street</p>Oncheoncheon Café Street is lined up with unique and exotic cafés that attract young people all year round. Above all, it is most crowded in the cherry blossom season. During the day, the beautiful scenery of bright pink cherry blossoms reflected in the Oncheoncheon stream catches people’s eyes, while at night, they are fascinated with a feast of cherry blossoms mingling with the streetlights.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Hwangnyeongsan Cherry Blossom Street</p>Hwangnyeongsan Mountain, one of Busan’s most famous mountains, has a cherry tree habitat formed along the road to the top. In spring, it is an ideal place to enjoy cherry blossoms along with Busan’s night view. In particular, if you drive when the cherry blossoms are falling, you will marvel at the beautiful scenery of falling petals like rain.\nAt the end of the road where petals are swirling, you will see the panoramic view of Busan soaking up spring.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Themed travel tours can be wonderful. \nIf you’re interested in various themed trips, then a gourmet tour for trying must-visit restaurants, an activity tour for exploring various experiences, and a story tour around the original downtown of Busan would be perfect for you. There are not only many things to eat and see but also various old stories about Busan to hear. The tour takes place across Jung-gu, Seo-gu, Dong-gu, and Yeongdo-gu, and it is especially guided by local seniors who have been residents in these areas for a long time. \nLet’s take a journey filled with interesting stories that will remind adults of the good old days as they reminisce about the old town of Busan, and give children a meaningful opportunity to gain new experiences.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Choryang Ibagu-gil</p>\nAlong the Ibagu-gil Trail in Dong-gu, Busan, you will find traces of Busan in modern times. Taking pride in the glorious past of this area that played a key role in opening ports to foreign trade, the former Baekje Hospital, which has turned to a café with a great atmosphere, and Choryang Church have great historical significance because they show modern Korean architectural styles. On the other hand, the mesmerizing, panoramic view of the Busanhang Port, from Kim Minbu Viewing Point to Yoo Chihwan Postbox, will leave you breathless. Furthermore, the 168 Stairs that connects the upper and lower mountain roads are well- known for preserving the heartwarming atmosphere of this old village. Moreover, the monorail installed for local residents who had to climb up and down the steep stairs provides visitors with a unique experience available only in Ibagu-gil.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Gamcheon Culture Village / Korean War Heritage Trail</p>\nSaha-gu and Seo-gu, Busan, are where you can feel what it was like to live as a refugee from the Korean War. In Gamcheon Culture Village, which was formed as Korean refugees settled down on a mountain slope, you can appreciate beautifully crafted murals while walking along the meandering alleys. This village only with the heartbreaking traces of the war eventually turned into a great piece of art that evokes strong emotions, thanks to the endless efforts of local residents and artists. Tombstone Culture Village where the Korean refugees built their homes on top of the tombstones for survival, Choi Min-Shik Gallery that exhibits photos capturing the lives of manual laborers at Jagalchi Market, and the Provisional Capital Memorial Hall, the former presidential residence, have become important cultural heritages of Busan, the wartime capital.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Yongdusan Trail / Gukje Market Trail</p>\nNo place can show Busan’s modern history than Jung-gu, as it connects Busan’s past and present, with famous cultural heritages, including Choryang Waegwan (a trading platform for Japanese people) built when Korea opened its ports to foreign trade, Busan Department Store with an architectural style influenced by Japan, the Busan Modern History Museum that vividly captures the moments of Busan in modern times, and Daegaksa Temple. Whenever you feel hungry during the tour around this area, you can simply visit Gukje Market, which is previously known as a place for Korean War refugees. The market is also filled with delicious local snacks that look as if there were heartrending and sorrowful stories behind them.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Yeongdo Bridge Trail / Huinnyeoul Village Trail</p>\nOnce you have your fill of delicious local snacks, it’s time to visit Yeongdo Bridge, an iconic symbol of Busan. Connecting Jung-gu and Yeongdo-gu, it is Korea’s first bascule bridge used as a meeting point for the refugees of the Korean War. As this area was filled with ship repair facilities in the past and often made the “ping (Kangkang)” sound, it was called “Kangkangee-gil Trail” \nHuinnyeoul Village Trail formed along the coastal cliffs in Yeongdo Island has become the most visited tourist destination throughout the year because it is widely known as a filming location. Walking along the coastal trail below the village, you will feel as if the sea in front of Yeongdo Island embraced you in its arms.\n\n\n"

Once on the ground, walk along Gunamro, where braille blocks are installed. You cannot miss Busan Aquarium equipped with an audio guide for people with visual impairments.\nDongbaek Park Coastal Trail throughout the park is wheelchair-friendly. Wheelchair rentals are available free of charge at Nurimaru APEC House. You can experience healing forests while strolling on the beautiful trail. Most of all, you can appreciate views of the mountains, the sea, and Gwangandaegyo Bridge all at once.\nHead out to The bay 101 located at the entrance of Dongbaekseom Island, where you can enjoy a meal or drink a cup of tea while gazing at the gorgeous night view. It also provides parking spaces, restrooms, and elevators for people with disabilities.\n<p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Route 2 : Songdo Beach, Skywalk, Cable Car − Amnam Park Observatory</p>\nSongdo Beach has a wheelchair accessible entrance with a gentle slope. Songdo Beach Skywalk, on the other hand, is Korea’s longest and curved sea overpath, which also has easily accessible facilities for people with disabilities.\nElectric wheelchairs are not allowed on the Songdo marine cable car for safety reasons; that is why it is recommended to change to a general wheelchair available on the spot. You can also enjoy the panoramic view of the sea at Sky Park Observatory (Amnam Park stop), which is equipped with accessible restrooms and other subsidiary facilities.\nAmnam Park is also one of the must-sees in Songdo. Its wheelchair-accessible trail is where you can enjoy the cool sea breeze and coastal scenery together.\n<p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Route 3 : Songjeong Beach − Fisheries Science Museum − Orangdae Park − Daebyeonhang Port − Jukseong Catholic Church</p>\nThe deck-type trail along the white sandy beach of Songjeong Beach is wheelchair-friendly and, at the same time, provides accessible restrooms.\nThe Fisheries Science Museum has a nice open-air observatory and a parking space and restrooms for people with disabilities. Admission is free of charge for the exhibition hall.\nOrangdae Park, the perfect place for enjoying the sunrise, is famous for its wheelchair-accessible trail located in front of the beach. Near the park, Daebyeon Port, a small fishing village with a beautiful lighthouse, is well known for anchovy, generally called Gijang Anchovy.\nJukseong Catholic Church, which has become famous as a filming location for dramas, takes pride in its picturesque landscape together with the view of a sea and the cathedral building. It is also wheelchair-friendly but does not have sufficient parking space.\n<p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Route 4 : Yeongdodaegyo Bridge − Kangkangee Arts Village − Jeoryeong Coastal Trail − Taejongdae Recreation Area</p>\nYeongdodaegyo Bridge is opened at 2 p.m. every day, and it is also wheelchair-friendly.

Today, it offers visitors the excitement of finding hidden works of art while quietly exploring the village. Because there are several dockyards and service companies in operation, it is recommended to visit the place on weekends or through the tour program.\nJeoryeong Coastal Trail allows you to meet the nearest oceanic view of Yeongdo. It also provides relatively easy accessible routes for people who use wheelchairs, or parking spaces and restrooms for people with disabilities who walk from the entrance to Huin-yeoul Coastal Tunnel. \nDanubi Train is available in Taejongdae Park, which you can use to explore the entire recreation area. Wheelchair rentals are provided free of charge. Come and enjoy the grotesque rocks and vast blue sea of Taejongdae Park.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "“Igidae” refers to the beautiful bedrocks consisting of delicate rocks\nin the eastern sea that the Jangsanbong Peak of Yongho-dong, Nam-gu, faces.\nThe name “Igidae” stands for the two gisaeng (female professional entertainers in Korean) from the Suyeong district who sacrificed their lives.\nDuring the Japanese invasion in Korea, when Japan conquered Suyeongseong Fortress and held a feast to celebrate their victory, two gisaeng, who are taken to the feast, grabbed a drunken Japanese commander and jumped into the sea.\nThe Igidae area was once closed for military operation reasons, but since 1993, it has been open to the public. At present, it contains dense forests that are difficult to meet in urban areas and is kept clean to serve as habitats for wildlife. Because of its clear water, the place is perfect for fishing.\nThe Igidae Trail, built along with the coastline, offers a gorgeous seashore scenery, which has been loved by many people since it opened. Walking on the trail that extends to the ring road and the Oryukdo Islets, you can enjoy every facet of Busan’s landmark. \nThe Igidae Coastal Trail, one of the hiking tracks of Nam-gu, is 4.7 km long, stretching from Dongsaengmal Trail - Global Gathering - Nongbawi Rock - Eoulmadang - Oryukdo Quay (2.5 hr walk). The hiking track starts from the bottom of Igidae View and continues along with the coastal cliffs, providing a dramatic scenery that embraces Gwangandaegyo Bridge, Busan Yacht Mooring Area, Marine City, Dongbaekseom Island, Nurimaru APEC House, and Haeundae Beach beyond the sea.\nThe Igidae Coastal Trail is part of the two famous trails, the Galmaetgil Trails and Haeparang Trail (Oryukdo Islets to Goseong). There, you can find diverse signposts on the walkway.\nAfter passing through the Dongsaengmal Trail, you’ll be walking on the overbridge reaching the Global Gathering. This place, where many tourists stop by, offers a perfect sunset view and is famous for appearing on the background of the movie “Haeundae.”\nWalking along the coastline, you can witness the exotic scenery made by coastal cliffs and the wave-built terrace. This place is the Busan National Geopark area that preserves rich geo-heritages, such as sea caves and potholes (marine potholes). The rocks with unique shapes have their own names, providing entertainment as you guess which is called what.\nOnce you go over the hill following the trail, you will reach Oryukdo Sunrise Park, a famous place to enjoy both sunset and sunrise. The skywalk in this park is built with glass, providing you a thrilling experience.  \nAnywhere on the Igidae Coastal Trail, you can pause to feel the breeze blowing from the ocean.\nAll your worries will disappear, with only the scenery of the blue ocean occupying your mind.\nThis is what we call a “good walkway.”\n\n\n"

They may make you miss the stop in the subway or on your way home, or keep you awake at night. Reportedly, you can meet famous webtoon characters in real life in Busan. Now, let us find the hidden places in Busan and fall for the charm of webtoons. \n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Busan Global Webtoon Center in Busan Culture Contents Complex</p>The two adorable characters, Will and Marry, who always match together, will catch your attention as they greet you at the entrance. Busan Global Webtoon Center is a complex place founded for supporting creative works and collaboration among cartoonists in the Busan and Gyeongsangnam-do region. Every year, the Busan Webtoon Festival is held in this place where you can meet diverse works of famous webcomic artists. If you are enthusiastic about Korean webcomics, you will likely meet your favorite webcomic artist here.\nAdding to webcomics based on popular dramas, it introduces works of new webcomic artists awarded in open manga exhibitions and invites famous foreign manga. If you are a big fan of webcomics, do not miss out on this festival. Other than looking around the exhibition, you will have a great chance to use and buy high-quality tools and draw your works!\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Webtoon Smi-Healing 101 in Urban Railway Minam Station</p>“Wow. I never thought a place like this exists.”\nIf you do not often use Minam Station, you will not notice this special place, even if you are a local. Smi-healing is a combination of “Smile” and “Healing.” Webtoon Smi-healing 101 is a place for people, who use the station, to smile and let them have a great time through webtoons.\nIt exhibits 101 famous works of webcomic artists from Busan. Webcomics are displayed on large walls and around stairways and passages of the station. Children and other citizens entering the station suddenly find pleasure with full-scale models of characters. They can even leave messages, such as emoticons, on one blank side of the wall.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Webtoon Ibagu-gil (Seongbuk Traditional Market)</p>People think that webcomics and traditional markets do not match well together. In Busan, however, you will see that this may not be true. The traditional market covered with paintings of webcomics is perfect together with various characters on the walls and signs with a unified design. You may even forget that you are in a traditional market.\nThe mix of red, yellow, and blue is pleasing to the eyes. As you walk to the market, you may stop and read manga in every shop you see. Because of this unique experience, you will forget about the time. If you find a manga with characters you like in a shop, you can haggle over the price. Isn’t that exciting? This is why Seongbuk Traditional Market has the nickname “Webtoon Ibagu-gil.”\n\n\n"

It is widely known for cultivating seaweed, and in spring, you will see a unique custom, where freshly harvested seaweed is hanged up to dry. Moreover, the panoramic view of the pine tree hills beyond the projecting rock, facing the breakwater’s red lighthouse, arouses a mysterious feeling inside you. The rocks on the seashore connected to the village are known as the “heaven” for anglers and seabirds.\nNow, pick up the pace as you follow the trail surrounded by pine trees and bamboo groves, heading to Haedong Yonggungsa Temple. It is one of the few temples in Korea that show the emerald ocean. People do not simply pass by the temple; they believe in the legend that at least one of your wishes will be answered here. Make a wish with reverence, and head back to the trail that leads to Fisheries Science Museum.\nFisheries Science Museum is located in the area nearest to the ocean. In this museum, you can learn about marine resources and future marine technologies. In particular, you will find a breathtaking aerial view on the observatory, which provides a great resting place for hikers traveling Gijang Coastal Trail.\nGijang-gun is also the place where Ananti Cove (Hilton Busan) is located. Famous for the vast blue ocean view of Gijang, it is more like a town, not just a hotel, as a complex for cluster and leisure; hence, the name Ananti Cove Town. This place is highly recommended when you want to eat food during your trip.\nFishing villages in Gijang are all small and cute. Pass by Dongam Port, and head to Orangdae Park, a unique park with the Yongwangdan Altar installed on top of a unique rock formation that wishes the fishers’ safe seaway. Walk slowly following the bumpy and rocky road to reach up to the Yongwangdan Altar, where you can hear the sound of ocean waves crashing against the rocks on the shore.\nHere lies the end of the coastal trail. From a distance, the lighthouses called Mazinger Z and Taekwon V appear as interesting infrastructures. Once you pass them, you are close to Yeonhwa-ri in Gijiang-gun. This small village is famous for fresh seafood that a haenyeo (female diver) freshly cultivates and its warm Jeonbok-juk (abalone rice porridge), a beloved Yeonhwa-ri specialty.\nAnchovies and seaweed cultivated in Daebyeonhang Port are well known nationwide. Every spring, the port holds the Anchovy Festival, where you can see fishers shaking off anchovies from a net. Take a relaxing time, strolling around the peaceful port with boats on the berth. Both sides are lined with stalls that mostly sell anchovies, salted anchovies, and seaweed products. You will not miss the opportunity to buy a bag of them. Choose anchovy or seaweed, or simply buy both of them.\nYou may prefer a relaxing trip to take a stroll and enjoy the ocean in Busan from a closed-packed schedule in the center. If so, Gijang Coastal Trail is here for you! \n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Starting from Children’s Grand Park, through Hwajisan Mountain Healing Forest, to Busan Citizens Park, prepare for trekking to calm your mind and body with green nature.\nLocated in the foot of Baegyangsan Mountain connected to Hwajisan Mountain, Children's Grand Park is perfect for enjoying the evergreen natural forests, full of various small and big trees mainly in Seongjigok Reservoir. With lush trees, you’d feel like you’re traveling in a remote countryside, even though you’re in the center of Busan.\nThe flat dirt paths extend from Children’s Grand Park toward Hwajisan Mountain. A few hikers in their casual clothes are walking among thick pine trees. Hwajisan Mountain is more like a back garden than a mountain for climbing, so anyone can easily climb the mountain and enjoy the healing forest. Walk along the evergreen forest, and breathe in fresh air to soothe your mood with nature’s therapy.\nAs you enter the path to climb up the summit of a mountain, you’ll find wonderful places that the community of pines in different shape offers. Suddenly, you’ll begin to wonder when countless trees have appeared. Now, you feel a sense of gratitude with the pine trees’ fragrance, blowing through the forest. Continue walking while steering through pine cones, and soon, you’ll notice the stone marker indicating that you’re near the peak.\nNow, it’s time to go down from the peak that you’ve reached. The sign that shows the way to Busan Citizens Park greets you. Before long, you’ll witness a cypress forest carrying the scent of phytoncide. Once you arrive here, take slower steps to enjoy the wind blowing through the trees stretched toward the sky, and settle and relax. From your view where the park gets closer, there’s a crape myrtle, Natural Monument of Korea, which blooms on a hot summer day and spends a hundred days splendidly. Return around the blossoming season, and direct the steps forward. \nEnter the bridge, known as “Ecobridge,” that connects Hwajisan Mountain to Busan Citizens Park. It is an ecological pathway, where people travel by day and animals by night. Thus, this bridge symbolizes the peaceful coexistence of people and animals.\nBusan Citizens Park, which you arrived through the Ecobridge, is a land that was returned to the citizens after 100 years of the Japanese occupation and the US force deployment. In the center, there’s a spacious, square lawn surrounded by different themes of nature, culture, and play. Enjoy a relaxing time as you take a stroll around Jeonpocheon Stream across the park. The Metasequoia Tree Road, Platanus Forest Path, and the Camellia Maze Garden will cleanse your soul. The cool water flowing from the large fountain relieves any exhaustion you may have, with children laughing and playing on the green grass tickling your ears.\nIt’s a pity that this beautiful place has been lost by external forces for 100 years. The past brings pain, but remembering and cherishing the memory could ease it.\n\nSit under the shade of a tree to bring peace to your mind and body.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "It’s a great trail to enjoy the forest bathing in the center of the city while taking a stroll along the hillside of Hwangnyeongsan Mountain. As it spans the four boroughs of Busan, it takes about five to six hours to travel there. If you’re not confident with walking along the ridges, you can choose one or two of the divided sections. They are connected like spider webs, so trekking by section will not be difficult.\nThe most popular single section for trekking starts from the Suyeonggu Public Sports Center, going through Geumnyeonsan Youth Training Center, climbing up to Hwangnyeongsan Beacon, and then returning to the original location. For this section, 2 hr is enough for beginners. There are some difficult parts on the uphill in the beginning, but the trail deck is well installed, so walking is easy.\nShortly after you begin from the Suyeonggu Public Sports Center, you’ll encounter a wooden stairway with the warmth of the forest. The peaceful forest, apart from the city, gives a silent and peaceful feeling. It’s like a breeze telling a story about the forest blowing through the branches of trees.\nOnce you reach to the Youth Training Center near Hwangnyeongsan Mountain, you’ll enjoy nature’s wonderful reward. The small observatory is located at the closest of Gwangandaegyo Bridge in Hwangryeongsan Mt. The great view on the observatory is like a small present as if you’ve climbed a long staircase.\nNow, you’ll walk on a flat road accompanied by nature for meditation. When you pass through the Youth Training Center and cross the street, you’ll reach a road wide enough for five or six people to walk together, so don’t worry about any uphills for a while. Travel over dirt tracks to help brighten up any dull moments in your walks.\nWhen you start feeling bored, you’ll see an eye-catching scene. Both sides of the trail are lined up with the lush hinoki cypress forest making you feel like taking a phytoncide shower. There are incredibly many cypress trees in the mountain. You’ll soon fall in love with the healing while walking on the trail, surrounded by the trees that soar to the sky. The phytoncide in the air refreshes your body.\nA new milestone, Baram Pass, greets travelers. You can see the sign of the Geumnyeonsan Mountain Youth Training Center you passed by. Now, you need to decide. If you’re not sure about climbing up to Hwangnyeongsan Beacon, head to Gyeongsung University and Namgu Library. However, the beacon is a must-see place of the mountain, so gather your courage, and move toward the peak.\nThe entrance path that reaches the mountain peak is all covered by the hinoki cypress forest. A cool breeze blowing through the mountain helps you forget the hard work of climbing. If you get out of the cypress forest, you have to endure a 20 min rough course of steep ascent. However, patience is a virtue. You’ll soon find yourself on the beacon, looking up at the sky close enough to touch, with the panoramic view of the city. You’ll finally notice how high the place is.\nNot far from the beacon is the stone marker that indicates Hwangnyeongsan Mountain peak, overlooking the city of Busan. Seeing the beautiful scenery where the ocean, mountain, and city are harmonized is a privilege only for those who climbed up the peak. It will long be remembered in your mind.\n\n\n"

Walk along the East Sea to have the best view of the ocean. \nAt the beginning of Course 1, Ilgwang Beach is a crescent moon–shaped beach that is quiet and secluded, yet it has a wide array of facilities, making it a great spot to stay at. The waves are mild, perfect for enjoying safe playtime in the water.\nMoontan Road is a path under the Dalmaji Hill has been known for the beautiful moonlight. Unlike the flamboyant Haeundae area, this road is great to take a leisurely stroll while admiring the ocean along the modest forest path during the day or night.\nGalmaetgil Course 2, which passes through Busan’s leading beaches of Haeundae and Gwangalli, is 18.3 km long from Moontan Road to Oryukdo Ferry Dock. \nWhat more can I say? Walk from Busan to the famous Haeundae Beach up to Dongbaekseom Island. You will also see Marine City and The bay 101, which are known for their exotic night view. \nWhen you see Gwangandaegyo Bridge, it means you are near the beach. Next to Gwangalli Beach is Millak Waterside Park, a hot spot for young people and Namcheon-dong Cherry Blossom Street that offers an endless cherry blossom tunnel in spring. Next, you can view the vast ocean at the Dongsaengmal Observatory of Idigae Cliff, where you can see both Haeundae and Gwangandaegyo Bridge.\nGalmaetgil Course 3, a total of 41 km long from Oryukdo Ferry Dock to Dongsam Innovation District, is a place where you will see many things unique in Busan.\nUN Memorial Cemetery in Korea, the only UN cemetery in the world, awaits visitors in a neat and well-established space. Once you enter, express your gratitude to the people who sacrificed their lives to help a far-away country.\nThe Gukje Market, which became famous thanks to a movie by the same title, is where you will find any type of item. Unlike in the scenes from a movie, the market is clean and renovated. The bustling noise and excitement, however, remain the same.\nExperience the grand scenery of the ocean where huge ships float on the ocean at Yeongdo Jeoryeong Coastal Trail. The trail starts from Huinnyeoul Culture Village, which became famous as the filming site of the movie “The Attorney,” connecting to Taejongdae Park, a mecca of coastal trekking that features walking along the coastal line. Take a break here from your Galmaetgil journey while you enjoy the oddly shaped rocks and vast ocean at Taejongdae Park at the end of Yeongdo.\n\n\n"

Let’s discover Dongnae’s historical attractions!\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Dongnae History Tour</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Dongnaeeupseong Imjinwaeran Museum  -  Dongnae-bu Magistrate’sOffice  – Dongnaehyanggyo Local Confucian School  -  Ancient Tombs in Bokcheon-dong – Bokcheon Museum – Dongnaeeupseong History Hall - JangYeong-sil Science Garden – NorthGate  -  Bukjangdae Command Post – Insaengmun Gate - ChungnyeolsaShrine</p>\nDuring the construction of Busan Metro Suan Station in 2005, a number of relics and remains of the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592 were discovered in the site. Moreover, the remains of civilians and the soldiers of Dongnae who were killed by Japanese invaders were found hundreds of years later. As such, the Suan Station Office has established the Dongnaeeupseong History Hall to introduce the story of Dongnaeeupseong at that time through its foundings. \nThe Dongnae-bu Magistrate's Office played the role of the Busan City Hall today. The Chungsindang Hall, where the magistrate used to work, is situated after passing the entrance. Retaining its old appearance, the hall displays the list of previous Dongnae-bu magistrates as well as the black and white photos of Dongnae-bu Magistrate’s Office and Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town. Moreover, it provides an experience program where visitors can try wearing traditional clothes.\nThe Dongnaehyanggyo Local Confucian School used to be the national school of the Joseon Dynasty. It has a two-story main gate named Banhwaru Pavilion with stone walls on both sides. Meanwhile, the Myeongnyundang Lecture Hall, which was the educational space for Confucian students, is characterized by its simple features, such as a black-tiled roof and pillars, as well as a patternless rafter, creating a calm atmosphere.\nThe Ancient Tombs’ area in Bokcheon-dong, which looks like a small park, is an important site with relics of the Period of Gaya Confederacy. While walking on the hill, you will find the square flower bed where a tomb was discovered, as well as the silver-domed outdoor exhibition hall. The exhibition hall displays the restored interior of the tomb of the period of the Gaya Confederacy. Moreover, the Bokcheon Museum exhibits the foundings of the Ancient Tombs in Bokcheon-dong and introduces the history of Korea’s tombs.\nA miniature model of the Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town is situated in the middle of the Dongnaeeupseong History Hall, which is a small single-storied hanok (traditional Korean house). Visitors are free to observe this model, which often draws children’s attention by comparing it with the real structure of the Walled Town.\nThe Jang Yeong-sil Science Garden is linked to the staircase behind the Dongnaeeupseong History Hall. It shows various scientific technologies of Jang Yeong-sil, who was the top scientist of the Joseon Dynasty from Dongnae, and displays his inventions, such as a celestial globe and a rain gauge. \nIf you pass through the North Gate by walking along a gravel path, you will reach the Bukjangdae Command Post on the peak of the Walled Town. Characterized by its black-tiled roof with white edges, the Bukjangdae Command Post is where the commander directed his army to defend the people and the area. It is said that those who passed this gate survived, but the rest who couldn’t come out died inside. Thus, this gate is also called “Insaengmun Gate,” which means “the gate of life.” \nThe Chungnyeolsa Shrine preserves the memorial tablets for those who died fighting for the country during the Japanese Invasion of 1592. This shrine is a simple building with neat features.\n\nIf you started the “Dongnae History Tour” lightheartedly, you will end it with a better understanding of local history and a deeper realization of the importance of its commemoration.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "A journey to discover Busan’s traces of humanities.\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Ancient Tombs in Bokcheon-dong / Bokcheon Museum / Dongnaeeupseong Imjinwaeran Museum</p>The first destination is Dongnae, which has various historical sites and relics.\nThe ancient tombs in Bokcheon-dong, which include the tombs of the Gaya Confederacy period’s ruling class, are considered as one of the most important cultural heritages for understanding Korea’s ancient culture. The Bokcheon Museum, on the other hand, displays many relics discovered from ancient tombs, showing Gaya’s excellent ironware culture and changes in ancient tomb styles.\nThe Dongnae area has been a significant excavation site, where several relics have been discovered. During the metro construction in 2005, a moat of the Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town was found in the site, telling the tragic story of the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592. The relics and remains of soldiers who died during the war were also unearthed hundreds of years later. The Dongnaeeupseong Imjinwaeran Museum, which shows the reproduction of the excavation, is located inside the Busan Metro Suan Station Office.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Busan Museum / Busan Modern History Museum / National Memorial Museum of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Occupation</p>The Busan Museum is the second destination in discovering the history of Busan, from prehistoric times to modern times, undergoing a few periods of turbulence.\nBuilt on the site of the former Oriental Development Company’s Busan Office, the Busan Modern History Museum shows the sorrows and painful times of Busan. After Korea’s independence, it was illegally used as the US Cultural Center in Busan for 50 years.\nThe National Memorial Museum of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Occupation is where visitors can experience the cruelty of Japanese imperialists who took everything away during the Joseon period. Along with other stories, such as the Joseon coal miners, soldiers, and women’s labor corps, the story of Japan’s forced mobilization should be shared and remembered.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Forty Stairs Cultural Center / Bosu Book Street</p>The Korean War left many traces in Busan. In particular, the Forty Stairs Cultural Center exhibits vivid records of the lives of war refugees who had to go up and down the Forty Stairs a dozen times a day to go to the Busanhang Port, Busan Station, etc.\nDuring the most difficult times, people lacked books as well. The Bosu Book Street was established by street bookstores selling secondhand books. In this street, visitors still look for their required books as if they were in a treasure hunt.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Choi Min-Shik Gallery / Yosan Literary Museum</p>The Choi Min-Shik Gallery offers another way to recall those difficult times by exhibiting the photos of the refugees’ lives during the war, showing the photographer’s life and the world of artworks. In addition, the Yosan Literary Museum displays the literary works of novelist Kim Jeonghan, who was heavily criticized by powerful people who took advantage of the chaotic atmosphere at the time.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Busan Cinema Center / Busan Museum of Art / Busan National Science Museum</p>Now, Busan has become the heart of culture by overcoming the sorrows of the past and developing cultural spaces. In October, the Busan International Film Festival was held at the Busan Cinema Center. Since its establishment in 1998, the Busan Museum of Art has been the space to vitalize local art activities and create citizens’ emotional culture. In addition, the Busan National Science Museum offers citizens the opportunity to experience the world of science and imagination.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Eternal Journey / F1963</p>Furthermore, the Eternal Journey bookstore serves as an exotic cultural space with the theme “book curation,” while the F1963, transformed from the old wire mill into a cultural complex, offers various cultural and art activities. Today, Busan is the city of culture and arts.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "In Ilgwangsan Mountain, there are no steep parts, so you can walk easily. Then, there’s a well-designed trekking trail, Ilgwangsan Mountain Theme Trail, and a path for mountain bikes. Cars are not allowed to access Ilgwangsan Theme Trail, so you can walk comfortably. It’s best to walk on autumn days when the beautiful and colorful leaves are everywhere. Take light steps, and enjoy the pleasant crunching sound as you walk along this gravel road.\nIlgwang Theme Forest Trail starts with a big sign informing that you’re at the entrance to the theme forest trail. It connects to Baegunsan Mountain as a trekking forest path, which takes more than 7 hr to walk. However, you don’t have to walk the whole thing; you can explore part of it. This time, let’s walk to Goksujeong Pavilion, where you can reach without much difficulty.\nA pavilion called Manhwajeong serves as a management office. Beyond this, a wide and straight trail stretches. The gravels underneath make pleasant crunching sounds. Various plants form colonies on both sides of your way, and you’ll have fun seeing different plants throughout your walk\nYou’ll come to the Dolsaem Sports Park, which is also called “Heotdulheotdul Madang,” with its various sports equipment. After the park, you can see the “Taegyoe Forest (forest for prenatal care)” signboard. The clear and clean forest air will deliver healthy energy to everyone, but particularly to the unborn baby. In the middle of the forest , there’s a wide pavilion and benches around where you can take a seat to feel the vitality of the forest.\nWalking along the gravel path, you’ll see a small pond, “Ilgwangsaem Spring,” and a signboard that indicates this place was once used for the mountain bike race course during the 2002 Busan Asian Games. The surrounding scenery, which slowly changes along the forest trail, is charming. It has the benefits of both a mountain and a park, and sometimes, it feels like a bicycle stadium when you see the mountain bikes zooming past you. This means your walk will never be boring! Just be careful about the bikes when they pass by.\nThere are many places to take a break in the middle, which is one of the advantages of Ilgwangsan Theme Trail. Head up to Moyeonjeong Pavilion on the hillside of the trail. Surrounded by refreshing green trees, the well is an ideal place for enjoying the forest path. The continued beautiful forest trail adds a refreshing feeling to the walk.\nGoksujeong Pavilion was once located in a valley through which the water twisted. Now, it’s more like a small pond, and the water surface reflects the old pavilion. Listen to the sounds of birds and water while enjoying the beautiful scenery. You will feel your distracting thoughts disappear as the forest seems to start telling you a story.\n\nIlgwangsan Theme Trail is not a path for fast walking to conquest the peak, but a way of enjoying the walk while exploring the value of slowness. As you take slow steps, you will be greeted by the unknown trees, flowers, and grass, away from the busy city.\n\n\n"

Recently, because of its distinctive exterior, it has become not only a unique spot but also a must-visit place for tourists. In Busan, surrounded by the East and South Seas, why not begin a tour by searching unique lighthouses?\nFor over 100 years, Yeongdo Lighthouse has provided a guiding signal to ships around Busanhang Port. Currently, equipped with an observatory, this lighthouse warmly welcomes travelers. Located on the steep cliff with an unobstructed sea view, Yeongdo Lighthouse serves as an ideal background for photography. Here, you can capture the entirety of Yeongdo’s vast coastal waters, Oryukdo Islets, and even Tsushima Island in the distance.\nTowering on top of Deungdaeseom Island, Oryukdo Lighthouse can be accessed only by boat. You can use a cruise ship at Oryukdo Ferry Dock to get to the island. Climb up the stairs that span the rocks to the rooftop, and you can see Tsushima Island with the naked eye on a sunny day. Then, you will realize Tsushima Island is really close to our territory.\nAre you ready to witness different lighthouses? There are Twin Lighthouses in the small port called Cheongsapo Village situated between Haeundae and Songjeong. Moreover, this village is a starting point for a lighthouse tour along the East Sea. The two lighthouses face each other: the red lighthouse looks like the rising sun, and the white one looks like broken waves. They are also called Husband-and-Wife Lighthouse or Couple Lighthouse.\nLocated at Yeonhwa-ri, Gijang, the Baby Bottle Lighthouse, which looks like a feeding bottle, is popular among prospective parents around childbirth who come here to pray for a healthy birth. On the contrary, the red lighthouse called Cockscomb Lighthouse will meet your gaze. As a cockscomb signifies a public official, this area was created as an “Anti-Corruption Pledge Path” in 2017, the year of the Rooster.\nWorld Cup Lighthouse, which guards the Daebyeon Embankment, was built to commemorate the entry into the semi-finals of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. This lighthouse would remind you of Red Devils holding a football in its chest. Moreover, you can see a uniquely shaped lighthouses called Guardian Post in the distance. White and yellow lighthouses face each other in pairs. The white lighthouse called Robot Taekwan V overlooks the sea to guide fishermen for their safety, while the yellow one faces the wave breaker to comfort their hard work.\nLet’s move further north along the coast. You can see the lighthouse hidden behind the popular Jukseong Catholic Church. Its white body and red roof are in perfect harmony with the pointed roof of the church.\nThe Baseball Lighthouse, wearing a baseball helmet along with a baseball and a glove, was built to commemorate the winning of the baseball game at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. It is located in Chiramhang Port, Gijang, which is famous as the Bungjangeo (whitespotted conger) Hoe Town. On the contrary, the Seagull Lighthouse that guards the breakwater embodies a flying seagull, a symbol of Busan, in a round shape of a baseball. Both of them are also famous sunrise spots.\n\nKnowing the stories of each lighthouse, you will see them in a different way. They shed light on the paths of travelers with different life stories.\n\n\n"

The Namparang Trail Busan Section traverses nature and downtown areas of Busan, showing the area’s beautiful trails covering the sea, forests, rivers, downtown areas, and villages. \n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Namparang Trail Busan Section</p>\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Course 1(23.2km)</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Oryukdo Sunrise Park – Sinseondae Terrace - WebtoonIbagu-gil – Yoo Chi-hwan Postbox - Choryang Ibagu-gil - Shanghai Street</p>\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Course 2(19.5km)</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Taejongdae Park - Gamji Beach – Jeoryeong Coastal Trail – Kangkangee Arts Village - Yeongdodaegyo Bridge - Jagalchi Market</p>\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Course 3(17.1km)</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Songdo Beach – Songdo  Coast Bollegil Trail - Amnam Park</p>\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Course 4(21.0km)</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Morundae Peninsula - Dadaepo Beach – Gowooni Ecological Trail – Jangnim Port</p>\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Course 5(18.7km)</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Eulsukdo Island - Myeongji Ocean City – Sinho Park - Sinhohang Port</p>\nNamparang Trail Busan Section Route 1 starts in Oryukdo Sunrise Park, which has a full view of the seashore cliffs and Oryukdo Islets lined up in the sea. It leads to Webtoon Ibagu-gil (Webtoon Street) filled with diverse cartoon characters as it passes through Sinseondae Terrace, where you can see Lego-like containers at the port. If you see a familiar cow picture between stairs, it means that you have just entered the Lee Jung Seop Street in honor of Artist Lee Jung-seop, who spent his last days in Busan. Along the mountainside road, you can notice a red mailbox and a gentleman next to it—the Yoo Chi-hwan Postbox. If you put a letter inside, it would be delivered a year later. This road also has a beautiful panoramic view overlooking Busanhang Port’s and Yeongdo’s coastal waters. As you go down 168 Stairs equipped with a monorail, you will be lured by the smell of dumplings. Welcome to Shanghai Street, also called Chinatown in Busan, and feast your eyes on its decoration of red lights.\nRoute 2 passes through Yeongdo. As you walk around the natural environment of Taejongdae Park, you will pass by Gamji Beach covered with fine pebbles. While walking on Jeoryeong Coastal Trail, you can get some rest and take pictures against the backdrop of the sea, where large ships float in the distance. As you get closer to Jagalchi Market, you will see the Kangkangee Arts Village, embracing Yeongdo’s painful history. Through this place that contains the history of South Korea’s modern shipbuilding industry, you will cross the Yeongdo Bridge, which tells the stories of the evacuees from the northern part of Korea during the Korean war.\nRoute 3 begins from Songdo Beach, which was reborn into an attraction because of the skywalk and the cable car that offer spectacular views over the ocean. As you enter Songdo Coast Bollegil Trail across the beach from the suspension bridge, you will encounter the red steel walkway following the coastline beside the coastal cliffs. Every step is in harmony with the rippling waves on the shore. The walkway leads to Amnam Park, which is famous for a lush green forest.\nFor Route 4, the starting point is the Morundae Peninsula located at the end of Dadaepo Beach, which boasts a vast and fine white sand beach. If you look at the endless sea, you will feel like you are on an uninhabited island. It is no wonder that anyone feels gratitude for the wonders of nature presented here. As you listen to the reeds on Gowooni Ecological Trail, you will enter the coastal trail. The colorful Jangnim Port stands beautifully under the rays of the setting sun.\nRoute 5 starts from Eulsukdo Island, serving as a guard through the Nakdonggang River. Let’s visit first the rectangular building called Nakdonggang Estuary Eco Center to learn about Eulsukdo Island—an island is filled with attractions, such as wetlands, pink muhly grass, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Busan. The route also runs from Eulsukdo to Sinhohang Port through Myeongji Ocean City.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Haeparang Trail, spaning 770 km from Oryukdo Sunrise Park in Busan to Goseong Unification Observatory in Gangwon-do, consists of 10 sections and 50 destinations. Meanwhile, the Haeparang Trail Busan Section called Buparang Trail comprises three sections. Let’s set off for Buparang Traill, which runs from Oryukdo Islets to Haeundae, from Mipo to Daebyeonhang Port in Gijang, and from Daebyeonhang Port to Imnang Beach.\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Haeparang Trail Busan Section</p>\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Course 1(17.8 km / 6 hr)</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Oryukdo Sunrise Park - Igidae Coastal Trail - Gwangalli Beach - Dongbaek Coastal Trail - Mipo Port </p>\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Course 2(16.3 km / 5 hr)</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Mipo Port - Dalmajigil Road - Moontan Road - Cheongsapo Port - Songjeong Beach - Haedong Yonggungsa Temple - Daebyeonhang Port</p>\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Course 3(16.9 km / 6 hr)</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Daebyeonhang Port - Ilgwang Beach - Chiramhang Port - Imnang Beach</p>\nRoute 1 begins from Oryukdo Islets and leads to Igidae Coastal Trail, where one side is full of a lush green forest, while the other side faces cliffs, white waves, and the blue sea. You can follow the wood deck path through the rough cliffs. Moreover, Gwangandaegyo Bridge, a symbol of Busan, looks different depending on your viewing positions. As you turn your steps, you can appreciate various views of the bridge from different angles. In no time, you’ll see other coastal cliffs and wood deck paths again. Now, you are on Dongbaekseom Coastal Trail, which is much less rough than Igidae Coastal Trail. Walking along the trail, you will see more people and buildings. Meanwhile, as you move toward the end of Haeundae, you will complete Route 1.\nRoute 2 begins from Mipo in Haeundae, the final destination of Route 1. Let’s head toward Dalmaji Pass through Mipo, a simple port in contrast with gorgeous Haeundae. By walking on Moontan Road filled with a thick scent of pine trees, you will experience the healing power of nature. Moreover, Haewoljeong Pavilion, located on top of the pass, allows you to enjoy the sea and the forest. Why not take pictures at the moon-shaped photo zone while resting? You can also follow the trail downhill, and you will see the Cheongsapo Daritdol Observatory stretching long over the blue ocean. Then, the route leads to Songjeong Beach and Jukdo Park, both of which retain the energy of the East Sea, followed by Haedong Yonggungsa Temple uniquely located along the shore. Can you see the strange formation, Orangdae, which rises above the sea? On top of it is the Yongwangdan Altar that used to serve as a venue for praying for fishermen’s safety. In addition, Daebyeonhang Port is the final destination of Route 2.\nFor Route 3, the starting point is Daebyeonhang Port, which is famous for anchovies. You can head toward the forest trail, passing by dried fish shops and raw fish restaurants lined up along the port. After walking along the mountain trails and village paths, you will soon reach a crescent-shaped beach called Ilgwang Beach. It has plenty of restaurants and cafés, which will serve as places to relax. Then, you can see a small park equipped with sailboats stretching out toward the sea. This is Sinpyeong Small Park. Why not pose at the end of the boat? You will surely feel excited like a sailor. The next spot is Chiramhang Port that features three lighthouses side by side along with the breakwater. The white lighthouse wears a black baseball helmet, with a baseball ball and a glove standing on either side of it. Furthermore, Route 3 of the Haeparang Trail Busan Section is called a lighthouse course because of the lighthouses of various shapes. The last destination is the Imnang Beach in Imnang, a serene and small seaside village.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "If you are in Busan, the mecca of filming, you can follow the footsteps of movie characters and feel like you are in the scenes with them. Let’s find those locations in Busan.\nAhopsan Forest in Gijang was a filming location for the film Kundo: Age of the Rampant. The dense bamboo forest is where Ha Jung-woo and Gang Dong-won performed exhilarating action scenesas the bamboo leaves rustling in the wind served as the background music. Both the bamboo and Geumgang Pine Trees (Pinus densiflora), such as the red pine tree habitat, contribute to the stunning beauty of nature and create the perfect walking trail.\nHuinnyeoul Culture Village is famous as a filming location for the film entitled The Attorney. The lines from the film written on the wall of Jin-woo’s house are so heartbreaking that it hurt viewers’ hearts. As you follow the alley that actor Song Kang-ho found in the movie, you’ll see the unobstructed sea unfolding over the low wall.\nAt the entrance of Nampo-dong is the Busan Department Store, a filming location for the film entitled The Thieves. With a history of more than 40 years, this building is a symbol of Busan’s modernization. As you explore the location, you can be easily reminded of the fierce voices of the actors who were shooting each other through the close-set windows.\nGukje Market is where the film entitled Ode to My Father was filmed, vividly showing the lives of refugees from the northern part of Korea during the Korean war. Kkotbunine, a store operated by the aunt of Deok-soo, a male main character in the movie, is still a popular attraction. In addition, there are many shops and eateries, where you can feel the generosity of Busan merchants.\nThe movie Oldboy will surely remind you of dumplings first. In Chinatown, there is a Chinese restaurant where actor Choi Min-sik ate various dishes from steamed and fried dumplings to jajangmyeon (noodles in black bean sauce). If you want to taste true Chinese food, you should go there.\nThe Busan Yachting Center is a famous filming location for many movies. It was also used as a background for the climactic scene of the film entitled Open City, where Son Ye-jin, who tried to escape to Japan, was being chased by Kim Myung-min. Moreover, Busan Cinema Studios is located here; that’s why it is loved by many filmmakers.\nAlmost everybody knows the famous line from the film entitled Friend, that goes, “Please stop. You’ve got enough.” In the movie, four friends showed their strong friendship on the level crossing called Railway Bridge in Beomil-dong.  It is where actors Jang Dong-gun and Yu Oh-seong, wearing school uniforms, were running like mad. Why don’t you try imitating the memorable movie scene?\nMipo Railway is a romantic place where Su-ho and Su-eun walked together in the movie entitled My Girl and I. This beautiful railway stretches out against a backdrop of the sea. Why not make romantic memories on the Mipo Railway, offering a retro mood?\nMipo Port, located at the end of Haeundae, is where the movie entitled Tidal Wave was filmed. In the scene where the seawater was surging, not only a raw fish restaurant appeared but also the level crossing. Although the site was chaotic because of a tsunami in the movie, in reality, it presents a beautiful horizon where the sky and the sea meet.\nIlgwang Beach in Gijang is the home of Dae-ho, the hero of the film entitled The Sheriff In Town, whose efforts to defend his hometown Gijang seemed funny yet touching. You can look at the beach in Dae-ho’s line of sight. What emotion is going through your mind?\n"

The wetland, located at the Nakdonggang River’s southern edge flowing into the South Sea, is where migratory birds and reeds coexist. It is also touching to see the harmony between the birds’ and humans’ footprints among the reeds. The single eye-catching pine tree among the golden reed fields swaying in the wind looks like a framed landscape painting on the wall along with the dazzling blue sky and sea, leaving you no choice but to appreciate nature’s blessing.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Now, 10 million people live with companion animals, with one1 in four4 households keeping a pet. With many people considering pets as family members, more and more have been traveling with them in recent years. Let’s look into Busan’s different spaces for walking pets.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Busan Citizens Park</p>Busan Citizens Park, located in Busan’s center, is already known by dog lovers as a remarkable walking route. It’s not only well- located but also large enough to be called Central Park. Hence, it’s an ideal place for dogs to de-stress as they walk on well-established trails, smell the earth and grass, and run around with their companion.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town</p>Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town in Dongnae-gu is where your dogs can run around freely on a large lawn. There is harmony between the walls and lawns, along with a beautiful view of downtown Busan. You can easily find dogs pleasantly walking on the trail along the fortress wall from Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town’s northern gate.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Oncheoncheon Park</p>Oncheoncheon Park in Dongnae-gu is a relaxing place to walk your dogs while feeling the cool river breeze. Pet owners happily watch their dogs leisurely walk, smell fragrant grass, and greet each other along the riverside.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Gwangalli Beach</p>Gwangalli Beach—a popular pet-walking spot in Busan—is the perfect place to give your dogs a unique experience of running around an open sandy beach as you walk while listening to the sound of waves and smelling the sea. The sandy beach and boardwalks are well organized, ensuring a convenient walk.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Busan Children's Grand Park</p>No place is better than Busan Children's Grand Park, where you can enjoy walking your dogs while listening to the sound of cool water flowing through the lush forest and breathing in the phytoncides’ power, the cypress forest aroma. Located in Choeup, this park has a dense forest with many boardwalks amid the trees, allowing older animals to enjoy walking without straining their joints.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">APEC Naru Park</p>APEC Naru Park is a well-organized urban park along the Suyeong Riverside. One of its outstanding features is a trail that allows you to walk your dogs along the riverside that beautifully harmonizes with the downtown landscape. It provides large lawns for active dogs to play and run around on.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Dadaepo Beach</p>Dadaepo Beach is characterized by a peaceful atmosphere and wide trails with waves flowing in and out of the park’s waterways, depending on the tide. Visitors take comfort in walking their dogs against the backdrop of the picturesque sea along with the spectacular sunset. In addition to dog walking, one of the beach’s attractions is a three-dimensional artwork of a dog gazing at the waves coming in.\n\nMany people visit all of the places mentioned, even those without dogs, so it’s proper to bring a leash and a dog waste bag to ensure an enjoyable time for all visitors.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Busan encompasses the sea, mountains, and rivers. Thanks to this natural environment, Busan can offer various experience programs tailored to people’s preferences. In particular, riding a bicycle along rivers and streams in Busan is another way of enjoying the city.\n\nOf course, to enjoy Busan by bike, you must have one. Do not worry if you do not have your own. A total of 12 public bicycle rental services are available free of charge or at an affordable price in different venues, such as Samnak, Hwamyeong, Maekdo, Daejeo Eco Parks, Spo1 Park, Jwasuyeonggyo Bridge, Eulsukdo Island, Oncheonjang Station, Oncheoncheon Park, and Millak-dong.\n\nLet us introduce the top five riding spots in Busan that are loved by riders.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Eulsukdo Eco Park</p>Eulsukdo Eco Park Bike Path, running along the riverside of the leisurely flowing Nakdonggang River, features lush vegetation in summer and swaying reeds in late fall. It is a pleasing experience to feel the breeze tickling your cheeks while riding a bike on a sunny day with clear skies. At sunset, you can become a rider running toward the golden hour, which is a magical time when everything in the world turns beautiful and picturesque.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Hwamyeong Eco Park</p>Hwamyeong Eco Park has been loved by riders because of a straight and smooth stretch of a bicycle path. The cool river breezes felt while riding a bike on the path through the lush vegetation will add to the exhilaration. In particular, it is a fantastic experience to ride through a green tunnel made by weeping trees.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Daejeo Eco Park</p>Another bike path is in Daejeo Eco Park, teeming with canola flower in spring and the pink muhly grass in autumn. The path runs along a straight tree-lined road, leading to an endless cherry tree tunnel. Why not slow down and pedal slowly to breathe in the refreshing scent of nature? Or stop for a moment, listening to the sound of the bamboo forest rustling in the breeze.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Suyeong Riverside Road</p>The Suyeong riverside, which runs between Haeundae and Suyeong, is where you can enjoy the unique charm of urban cycling that you cannot experience on the Nakdonggang riverside. Rather than speeding up, you should pedal slowly, adjusting the intensity levels, to experience the attraction. The well-maintained bike path along the Suyeonggang River makes you feel refreshed. You can also relax in APEC Naru Park on the riverside. Otherwise, you can enjoy a leisurely ride to Gwangalli Beach.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Oncheoncheon Park</p>Oncheoncheon Park Bike Path, which runs along the Oncheoncheon Stream, Busan’s major urban stream, is where you can experience the attraction of the stream while riding comfortably. This path is not popular for cherry blossoms in spring, but it is where you can enjoy cycling all year round. Oncheoncheon Café Street is also well established, so this park is a perfect place for you to relax and enjoy a romantic time while riding a bike.\n\nEven the same place gives you different feelings and memories, depending on who will accompany you on the trip and how you will enjoy it. You can come to those venues for a picnic or a walk, but biking through Busan will be a unique experience, won’t it?\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Gupo Obstacle-Free Trail, which rises in the middle of Gupo, has a panoramic view of the Nakdonggang River. The course is about 2 km long and accessible to everyone, regardless of age and gender. Thus, this place is  highly recommended for people who want to go hiking but have difficulty to do so.\nGupo Obstacle-Free Trail, which opened in 2013, is a barrier-free forest trail. In other words, it’s accessible to people with disabilities, the elderly and infirm, children, and even pregnant women. This trail has a slope without stairs from the starting point to the top of Beombangsan Mountain. Located near subway stations, it’s easy to access. Get off at Gunam or Gumyeong Station and stroll, and you’ll arrive at a small parking lot designed for visitors in no time.\nBefore you take a walk, go through the yellow gate at the entrance of the barrier-free forest trail. It’s a boardwalk that allows anyone to walk in comfort. The forest trail is in a series of zigzags, thus adding fun to your walking tour, which could otherwise be boring. On both sides is a natural fairy tale scenery unfolded, and the fresh air assures you the pleasure of walking.\nIf you’re tired from walking, why not get some rest on a bench? Looking around while relaxing on a bench, you’ll find the forest ecosystem that you haven’t seen before. You’ll also see trees and flowers that you rarely encountered, and even animals running around the woods if you’re lucky.\nBefore reaching the first observatory, you can see the well-maintained Seongang Mineral Spring equipped with simple sporting equipment. This place is frequently used by people who take walks. As you watch people work out using the equipment, you may feel like you’re also exercising. Drink the cool mineral water after exercise, and it will instantly quench your thirst.\nPassing through the second observatory, you’ll get to the summit of Beombangsan Mountain. On top of it, you can see Haneulbaram (sky and wind) Observatory, which takes pride in an open view as if it’s merging into the sky. Your heavy thoughts will be swept away because of the panoramic view of Gangseo-gu and Gupo areas, in which the Nakdonggang River flows leisurely. This is also the best place for you to enjoy a spectacular sunset. As you witness people conversing and sitting on the wooden pavilion against the setting sun, you may become sentimental.\nFor those in strollers or wheelchairs, the top of a mountain is probably a long way off. However, this barrier-free trail is accessible to anyone, even people with disabilities and the elderly and infirm. If you want to enjoy a lush forest trail while breathing in fresh air, or appreciate the beautiful landscape of the Nakdonggang River, don’t hesitate to go to Gupo Obstacle-Free Trail!\n\n\n"

The mysterious scenery of vessels anchored in the anchorage area of the glowing golden sea in the distance is another impression presented by the bridge. Let’s relax at Songdo Beach, which is now at its best because of the skywalk, also known as cloud trails, and overwater cable cars. Then, take a walk on Songdo Coast Bollegil Trail, running along the rugged cliffs of unique rock formations. At the end of the daunting cliff, a boardwalk appears at Amnam Park, where lush woods harmonize with the blue sea. As you hurry on the way, you’ll reach Dadaepo Beach, which has been preserved in its natural state, with a spacious beach park.\nAs you start from the Nakdonggang Estuary Embankment, travel to Galmaetgil Trail 5, encompassing Gadeokdo Island. Once you reach Yeondaebong Peak, the highest peak on the island, you can see Tsushima Island from a distance, with the beautiful coastlines of the South Sea. The small fishing village Daehanghang Port shows the natural beauty of the mountains and the sea. Moreover, the idyllic landscape blends in with the sea, creating a picturesque landscape. Jeonggeo Village features a higher quality of murals that embody the history of Gadeokdo Island. You can read the history of the island from the murals of the beautiful village facing the sea.\nGalmaetgil Trail 6 starts from the Nakdonggang Estuary Embankment, passes through Unsusa Temple and Seonamsa Temple via the Nakdonggang riverside and ends at Seongjigok Reservoir, where Busan Children’s Grand Park is located.\nSamnak Eco Park, where the Busan International Rock Festival takes place in summer, is an ideal venue for people to stroll leisurely or ride a bike along the riverside. Walking along the Nakdonggang River, you’ll  reach Gupo Station, followed by Baegyangsan Mountain. The first temple you see on the mountain is Unsusa Temple, located on a hilltop, which has a fine and graceful figure. The Beomjongru Pavilion, which overlooks the vast Nakdonggang River, is the best part of this temple. Here, anyone is allowed to ring the bell, as people make their wishes.\nSeonamsa Temple features an impressive steep staircase leading up to the Iljumun Gate, the main gate of the temple. Along with the lush green woods, the large boulder served as a symbolic guard of this temple.\nLeaving behind Seonamsa Temple located in the mountain, head for Seongjigok Reservoir, which has a walking trail with gentle slopes. Straight, tall trees in the dense forest make you feel like you’re walking in the deep mountain. The placid lake, surrounded by all kinds of trees, looks peaceful.\nLet’s wrap up Galmaetgil Trail 6, as you walk along the high embankment path of Seongjigok Reservoir.\n\n\n\n"

These trails allow people to enjoy hiking in two major mountains: Geumjeongsan Mountain and Ilgwangsan Mountain.\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Course 7</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Section 7-1, 9.3 km / 4 hr: Seongjigok Reservoir – East Gate of Geumjeongsanseong Fortress</br>Section 7-2, 13.0 km / 5 hr: East Gate of Geumjeongsanseong Fortress – Sanghyeon Village</p>\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Course 8</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Section 8-1, 10.2 km / 3 hr: Sanghyeon Village – Dongcheongyo Bridge (Seokdae Bridge)</br>Section 8-2, 7.0 km / 2 hr: Dongcheongyo Bridge (Seokdae Bridge) – Millakgyo Bridge</p>\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Course 9</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Section 9-1, 11.5 km / 3 hr: Sanghyeon Village – Igok Village</br>Section 9-2, 9.0 km / 3 hr: Igok Village – Gijang-gun Office</p>\n\nThe starting point of Galmaetgil Trail 7 is Seongjigok Reservoir. If you go up the mountain through the walkable trail of the reservoir, you’ll cross Mandeok Pass, heading to Geumjeongsan Mountain. The road to the northern gate of Geumjeongsanseong Fortress, the largest mountain fortress in South Korea, is rough but provides a superb panoramic view of Busan with a picturesque landscape of the fortress, running along the Geumjeongsan ridge. Let yourself feel the cool breeze and the refreshing air permeate deep into your lungs, relieving you of stress and fatigue. While hiking, you’ll encounter magic potions that make your heavy footsteps lighter. Those are Sanseong Makgeolli and goat meat, which appease your hunger. Going downhill, you will see Beomeosa Temple, which has been around for a millennium. Entering the temple precinct after passing the valley filled with large rocks, you’ll experience the healing power of its stone wall path. The mountain terrain behind the magnificent Daeungjeon Hall is overwhelmingly marvelous. Geumjeongsan Mountain and Beomeosa Temple below seem to merge as if they were originally one unit, creating a phenomenal landscape.\n\nSanghyeon Village, the starting point of Galmaetgil Trails 8 and 9, is a small village located next to Hoedong Reservoir. The house roofs, the trees planted around the reservoir, and the lake beyond the village perfectly mingle with each other. Moreover, the mountain ridge surrounding the reservoir like a folding screen, and the clear sky and white clouds reflected in the lake are in harmony, creating a scenic landscape. Walking on the Dullegil trail, you’ll reach Ttangmoesan Eco Forest. Why not take off your heavy hiking boots for a while? Although small, this lush hinoki cypress forest has a red clay trail where you can walk barefoot, relieving you of foot fatigue.\nLet’s move on along the Suyeonggang River that runs straight out to the sea. Walking along the Suyeong riverside with a well-maintained pedestrian passage, you can see Centum City full of skyscrapers. The last destination of Galmaetgil Trail 8 is APEC Naru Park, a green area for resting in Centum City, Busan’s major high-tech city.\nStarting from Hoedong Reservoir, Galmaetgil Trail 8 that is designed for walking on Ilgwangsan Theme Forest Road features a wide and smooth gravel path leading ultimately to the Gijang-gun Office. This section, where the mountain bike racing took place, is also loved by MTB enthusiasts. With its diverse tree communities on both sides of Ilgwangsan Theme Forest Trail, you can enjoy the freshness of green vegetation throughout the walk. Moreover, this trail has repeated uphills and downhills, so there’s no time to get bored. At the end of the trail, you’ll see a graceful figure called Moyeonjeong Pavilion, where you can take the best shot of the Galmaetgil Trail while resting. Now, let’s move on pleasantly to the last destination of the 9-2 section, the Gijang-gun Office.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "In Busan, there are many walking trails with stunning views of the ocean, including Taejongdae Park in Yeongdo Island, Jeoryeong Coastal Trail, Amnam Park Coastal Trail in Seo-gu, and Igidae Coastal Trail in Nam-gu just to name a few. Among them, Gadeokdo Coastal Trail, located at the southernmost part of Busan, is lesser known, which is odd considering its amazing beauty. This quiet, secluded, 6 km long trail out in nature where there are fewer people connects Dongseon Saebaji to Daehang Saebaji (Saebaji refers to a place where the east wind blows.). It is in perfect harmony with the unique rock formations and the blue ocean.\nAfter getting off at the last stop of Bus 58 and walking in the direction of Dongseon Saebaji, you’ll find the beautiful coastal trail, a perfect tour route for drinking in the scenery of the ocean in harmony with awe-inspiring rocks and the blue sky. The beautiful, panoramic scenery of the South Sea will unfold before your eyes. In what looks like a painting, you’ll find fishers trying to catch fish on the rocks here and there on the seashore.\nOnce you pass by a prayer house on a flat coastal trail, you’ll realize that you’re about to go uphill into the forest. On your way to Eoeumpo Port, you’ll find a vast empty lot. This place is called Nureungneung Pass. Until the 1970s, it was a residential area. Now, however, there’s only an observatory where you can take a rest for a moment. Once you reach the top of the Nureungneung Observatory, you’ll find yourself breathing a little heavy, and you’ll immediately understand why a rest area was built specifically in this place. The breathtaking view of the blue ocean and the charming coastal line below your feet will surprise you. You’ll fall in love with the ocean. In case you spot a fishing boat in the ocean, you can’t take your eyes off of it until it completely goes out of sight.\nAlong the forest trail from Eoeumpo Port to Daehang Saebaji, you’ll find a colony of pine trees so dense that little sunlight can reach the ground. While walking along the forest trail, you’ll hear the refreshing sound of water flowing in the Eoeumpo Valley toward the sea in front of Gadeokdo Island. Eoeumpo Port, a former port rich with fish, is now used as a resting place for busy travelers. As Gadeokdo Dullegil Trail consists of both coastal and mountaineering trails, you can go on a walking tour that involves crossing the valley right below the mountaintop. After going up and down along the coastal trail with no chance to feel bored, you’ll find yourself reaching the Huimangjeong Pavilion. A pavilion and a deck were built in this place, where a coastal guard post used to be. It’s a perfect place to enjoy the scenery. Without noticing it, you’ll get carried away by the beautiful scenery seen from the Huimangjeong Pavilion.\nWhen you reach the end of the meandering coastal trail, Daehang Saebaji Village comes into sight. The pebble beach in Daehang Saebaji is known for having an artificial cave built by mining engineers and Korean forced labor during the Japanese Occupation. It’s heartbreaking to see the other side of this little port embracing the beautiful, emerald ocean as it used to be a place of suffering for Korean laborers drafted by the Japanese Imperial Army. This place is marked by the pain of the hidden past but is now being translated into the present, moving toward a new future.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "BTS: Famous for having 3 no. 1 albums in less than a year on the Billboard charts as of November 2019! \nEven if you’re not familiar with K-pop idols, you must have heard of BTS, whose members have a special relationship with Busan. This is because Jimin and Jungkook of this seven-person idol group come from Busan.\nToday, you can follow the memories and traces of Jungkook, the youngest member of the BTS, who spent his childhood in Mandeok-dong. It would also be great to listen to one of BTS’s songs associated with each destination.\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Jungkook Tour Course</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Baekyang Elementary School - Baekyang Middle School - Mandeok Lego Village - Mandeok Duck Folk Village - Seokbulsa Temple</p>\nThe first place you’ll visit is Baekyang Elementary School. This is the elementary school Jungkook attended from grades 1–6. The schoolyard on which Jungkook must have found it fun to play is still filled with children’s laughter. Perhaps, Jungkook’s love and passion for sports can be traced back to this place. It would be fun to imagine Jungkook on his way to school on this path in front of Baekyang Elementary School that he must have walked back and forth a few thousand times until he started to dream of becoming a singer. In its nearby area, you can also find Baekyang Middle School, where he attended before he moved to Seoul. Why don’t you take a walk while listening to BTS’s “Born Singer,” a song about their feelings right after making their debut, “Ma City,” famous for its lyrics including “the Busan Sea” and written by the members who are not from Seoul, and “Euphoria,” Jungkook’s solo song? \nMandeok Lego Village is located in the nearby area. This village’s name stimulates your curiosity. If you look at the colorful roofs of the houses, you’ll understand why it’s called as such. The village was formed as it accommodated dwelling houses with orange roofs for 54 households in 1986. It’s called Mandeok Lego Village because the view of these houses reminds you of colorful Lego blocks. It would be nice to listen to BTS’s “Go Go” as you soak up the bright and lively atmosphere of the village. It’s famous among photographers for its unique atmosphere. As this is a residential area, silence must be observed.\n\nOne of the famous tourist destinations in Mandeok where Jungkook was raised is Mandeok Duck Folk Village. This place is a famous food alley in Busan and is filled with the smell of grilled marinated duck from restaurants all along the street. In this duck folk village that attracts hungry travelers, feel free to enjoy grilled marinated duck with fragrant chives. That way, you can enjoy a delicious hearty meal that can even compete with a sumptuous feast.\nIf you want to escape from the city, you should head to Byeongpungam Seokbulsa Temple. Named after the fact that the cliffs surrounding a temple are like a folding screen, Byeongpungam Seokbulsa Temple provides a panoramic view of Maneok-dong. The beauty of the stone Buddha carved into the cliff makes the temple more mysterious. This is a perfect fit for you if you want to enjoy quiet relaxation under rock cliffs. Listening to BTS’s “Butterfly” out in nature, you’d feel as if you were in a scene from a BTS music video.\nJungkook made his debut at a young age compared to the other members. For him, it all began right here in Busan.  And his time spent in Busan is right here in Mandeok-dong.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "BTS ranked top on the Billboard charts, won a Grammy award, and had 62 concerts (Love Yourself / Speak Yourself) as part of their 2018–19 world tour. BTS has had an astonishing run of setting and breaking records. \n\nJimin is a member of a globally famous idol group BTS, nicknamed the “fan-making fairy.” What did Jimin’s childhood look like? By traveling around Geumjeong-gu, Jimin’s hometown, you’ll find the traces of Jimin, who is known as the “fan attractor” among the BTS members.\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Jimin Tour Course</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Hoedong Maru(Former Hoedong Elementary School) – Dadaepo Beach - Sunset Fountain of Dreams</p>\nThe first destination is Hoedong Elementary School, where Jimin attended. Unfortunately, the school was closed in 2018 and renamed Hoedong Maru. After realizing that his former school was being transformed into a creative experience, Jimin sent his congratulations in person to celebrate the opening of Hoedong Maru.\nHoedong Maru is a place still filled with children’s laughter, consisting of the Nutrition Experience Center and the Creative Factory. At the Nutrition Experience Center, children can learn how to maintain a healthy life by using all their five senses. They participate in nutrition education programs associated with the official school curriculum that involves nutrition experience, cooking class, and gardening. The school offers various age-appropriate programs, particularly drawing attention from international ARMYs (the fan base of BTS) interested in Korean cuisine. At the Creative Factory, it’s possible to create diverse products using wood, fabrics, recyclable materials, 3D printers, and 3D pens. It’s the most beloved place for children to learn about their career paths.\nApart from Hoedong Maru, another must-visit place in Geumjeong-gu is a famous café close to Oncheonjang Station on Busan Metro Line. Equipped with its own roasting facility, this café is known for producing the winner of the 2019 World Barista Championship. Every season, new fruit beverages are launched in collaboration with local farms. At the bakery, the smell of freshly baked bread will put you in a good mood. The tranquil scenery of the café garden went viral on social media. It’s a perfect place to take a rest and curb your travel fatigue.\nIt’s Dadaepo Beach! In 2016, Jimin visited Dadaepo Beach, with its stunning view of the sunset, and made a wish for the new year.  Jimin posed for a photo looking as if he supported the sun turning red and going down on his hand. Since then, this pose has been ARMYs’ favorite. Dadaepo Beach is located where Nakdonggang Estuary meets the South Sea. It is the world’s most beautiful sunset and a tourist destination often visited by travelers who fall in love with the scenery of the cozy sea with golden waves. In addition, a water show accompanied by BTS’s music is often held on BTS’s anniversaries (such as debut date and fan meeting date) at the Sunset Fountain of Dreams, the pride of Dadaepo Beach.\nJimin spent his childhood in the romantic city Busan, dreaming of becoming a singer.\nNow, he’s a globally renowned singer, but he was once a kid, coming home from school with a snack in his mouth. Taking a walk around a place full of memories itself can make your heart go pit-a-pat even more if these memories belong to your favorite star!\n"

Haeundae, which boasts a wide and beautiful white sand beach, shines like an oasis among skyscrapers.\nSongjeong Beach welcomes you after you drive down the winding scenic thoroughfare called Dalmajigil Road. Songjeong Beach features a cozy atmosphere, and a panoramic view of the beach viewed from Jukdo Park is picturesque. Ten minutes after leaving Songjeong Beach, you can enjoy the romance of travel at Daebyeonhang Port, where the East and South Seas meet.\nJukseong Catholic Church\nSituated in a picturesque seaside village full of rustic charm, Jukseong Catholic Church is well known for its harmonious combination of sky, sea, and church. Simply standing in front of the church makes you feel as if you’re a leading character in a painting.\n<p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Course 2: Taejongdae Park – Namhangdaegyo Bridge – Songdo Beach – Dadaepo Beach</p>\nTo feel a different atmosphere from the East Sea, drive westward to see the South Sea.\nTaejongdae Park boasts a phenomenal scenery filled with sheer cliffs and unique rock formation. Enjoy the scenic views by Danubi Train during the day, and feel free to go for a drive at night.\nLet’s go to Songdo Beach via Namhangdaegyo Bridge from Yeongseon-dong in Yeongdo. You’ll be amazed at the mysterious spectacle of the anchorage while driving on the bridge.\nLet’s take a break at Songdo Beach. Take a walk on Korea’s Songdo Skywalk, longest cloud trail, and experience stunning views of the sea in an overwater cable car.\nThe last destination is Dadaepo Beach, well known for its dazzling golden sunset. Why not appreciate the short bliss of sunset here? The scenery occurs at that very moment, but the afterglow lasts for a long time.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">A romantic drive on the mountainside road</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Course: Leejungseop View Point – Yoo Chihwan Postbox – Jungang Park – Ebagu Archive Center</p>\nOne of the best viewing points in Busan is the mountainside road. Let’s begin our drive on the mountainside road that runs from Dong-gu to Jung-gu along a hillside, where you can find the real charm of Busan.\nAt the entrance to the mountainside road, you can see a space called Leejungseop View Point designed to commemorate Lee Jung-seop, the artistic genius of Korean modern art. Appreciating a panoramic view of the residential area in Beomil-dong, you can see signs of him at the nearby rest area.\nDriving carefully along the winding road called Mangyang-ro, you’ll reach Yoo Chihwan Postbox Observatory. You can enjoy both the view of the densely packed houses at the foot of Gubongsan Mountain and the stunning Busanhang Port. When the sun goes down, this place creates an exquisite balance between the colorful lights of Busanhangdaegyo Bridge and the soft glow of the mountainside road.\nLocated at the top of Daecheongsan Mountain, Jungang Park has a wide rest area, a green forest, and a panoramic viewpoint. Why not relax while taking a walk in Jungang Park, which has long served as a comfortable rest area for Busan citizens?\nThe Ebagu Workshop Observatory is a 10 min walk from this park. You can watch an interesting exhibition related to the mountainside road and enjoy interesting experiences. A picturesque panoramic view of the Busan downtown areas can be seen from the viewing point on the rooftop. If you have time, take the 168 Stairs MonoRail.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "With the presence of online bookstores that offer overnight delivery service and large bookstores that sell even miscellaneous goods such as stationery and daily necessities., local bookstores disappeared some time ago. However, small local bookstores, which seem to exist only in our memories, have just begun to open again. Unique bookstores, where we can consume both books and culture, serve as distinctive venues for culture and art, giving visitors unusual enjoyment.\nThere is a small universe within Bosu Book Street. Its charming Provence-style appearance is so impressive that it looks like a prop shop at first glance. \nOnce inside, you’ll be surprised at its cozy interior that looks like a nicely decorated café. The ivory interior on the ceiling creates a warm atmosphere, while the pretty postcards and various handicrafts on display will leave you smiling.\nThe interior teems with unique and attractive publications. The representative of this bookstore, who loves reading books, says that this space is designed to introduce each of the self-published works that are too good to be forgotten. Instead of bestselling books, this space is mainly filled with self-published literature chosen carefully by the bookstore owner.\n\n\n\nGeumjeong-gu also has a unique bookstore that primarily deals with liberal arts books, workbooks, and used original-language editions. Well known as a book café that serves as a bookstore and book café, it’s an excellent place to read quietly. It has a group seating area, also used by book clubs. You can make a  reservation and rent a space as well.\nThe modern interior and open views are relaxing. Aside from simply selling books, it encourages people to participate in various events every week. It hosts different programs for reading and learning such as conversations with poets, a book talk, calligraphy, and an English speech. This is one of the rare bookstores in Busan devoted to communicating with people through unique programs.\n\n\n\nLocated on the second floor of a retro vintage building, this place intends not to sell only books from the entrance. Old event posters and upcoming book talk schedules silently tell the bookstore’s journey up to date. \n\nGoing inside, you’ll be soaked in the smells of books and sweet coffee. Under the slogan of “books and coffee,” which sounds like an advertising phrase, this space mainly handles self-published works such as daily records rather than well-known books.\nThe books, which are strictly selected by the bookstore owner, look relatively clunky but teem with wit and humor, and most of which would require contemplation. Self-published poetry books or essay collections that didn’t have a chance to be promoted if you look at those books one by one, you may luckily find a hidden gem.\nThese unique bookstores are dreaming of the second heyday of the off-line bookstore market that keeps getting smaller by attracting readers through diverse programs. They become recognized as new cultural spaces by forming a fan base among not only Busan citizens but also local and international travelers.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Just before greeting the New Year, people first plan on a sunrise trip. Busan, surrounded by the South and East Seas and their different colors, offers diverse sunrise landscapes. The sun comes up every day in the same way, but it may look different depending on your viewing point. Let’s visit scenic sunrise points in Busan.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Haeundae Beach</p>As a world-famous tourist spot, Haeundae Beach offers an expansive sandy beach and an unobstructed coastal view. At either edge of the beach is Dalmaji Pass and Dongbaekseom Island. When the sun rises just over the horizon, the glittering light is unimpededly projected onto the skyscrapers, creating a phenomenal scene. The repeatedly incoming waves and the white sea foam splashing and crashing onto the fine sand, create  a dazzling scene in harmony with the glowing red light of the rising sun.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Gwangalli Beach</p>The sunrise on Gwangalli Beach is a must-see, which colors Gwangandaegyo Bridge like a golden curtain. Gwangandaegyo Bridge shows off its grandeur across the coastal waters of Gwangalli. When the sun comes up slowly below the bridge and hangs over its top, its beauty will leave you astounded. When the sun peeks over the horizon, slowly showing its perfection, the entire Gwangalli Beach turns golden. This is so touching that you’ll be speechless.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Songjeong Beach</p>Songjeong Beach, also known as a mecca for surfing, preserves the wonders of nature because it has a relatively secluded location compared with Haeundae or Gwangalli Beach in the downtown areas. The sunrise points of this beach include Jukdo Park at the edge of the coast and the Songiljeong Pavilion in the park. When the sun rises between the rising rocks from the sea, breaking the boundary of the horizon, the silhouette of Songiljeong Pavilion creates a strange contrast with the red sky. In the early morning when a flood of golden light from the rising sun is pouring down on the beach, paddleboarders floating on the sea look exotic.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Jukseong Catholic Church</p>Jukseong Catholic Church is well known for the dazzling blue sea during the day and the night sea in pitch darkness. It’s also famous as a scenic sunrise spot for photography. Behind the building with a steeple in the shape of a regular square pyramid, the glowing red sky blends in with the surroundings, creating a breathtaking landscape. At dawn, the lighthouse, silently overlooking fishing boats, followed by a flock of sea birds, is impressively dramatic.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Orangdae Park</p>Orangdae Park is where you can enjoy listening to sea birds’ cawing out their avian song, along with the sound of the waves, standing on a rock on the seashore past the coastal trail. At dawn, the towering Yongwangdan Altar greets the rising sun. It usually has roaring waves, but when the weather is good, you can appreciate the omega-shaped sunrise above the gentle water. You can experience delicate harmony between the Yongwangdan Altar and the sunrise, and say a little prayer for calm sea conditions, or make a wish for the year.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "One of Busan’s greatest charms is the combination of the sea, mountains, and rivers. With its various natural environments, Busan offers diverse sunset landscapes depending on sunset points.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Amisan Observatory</p>Let's climb up to Amisan Observatory, which provides a panoramic view of both the Nakdonggang Estuary and Dadaepo Beach. Dadaepo Beach is located at the last point where the 700 ri (about 275 km) long Nakdong River flows into the sea. Sands deposited by the river made a huge island, and the fertile land became a haven for migratory birds. Visiting Amisan Observatory at dusk, you can see the glow of the setting sun changing from pale golden color to dark red. The sky and the sea turn red, sharply in contrast with the silhouette of mountain ridges and sand islands. The phenomenal scenery of nature viewed from the observatory is out of reach, so it is fonder and more wistful. The magnificence and mystery of nature created by the boundary between the sun, the river, and the sand islands are compelling.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Dadaepo Beach</p>Dadaepo Beach, glowing golden when painted by sunsets, is always crowded with people who want to celebrate the moment. The biggest charm of the sunset at Dadaepo Beach is the spectacular unobstructed view unfolding above. It just merges into the silhouette of the mountain ridges in the distance, the boundary between the sky and the sea, and the red sun hanging over it. The trail that runs across the vast reed forest at one edge of the beach is where you can enjoy and be one with the sunset-drenched reed beds. In addition, the sunset-drenched reeds swaying in the wind make the scenery more spectacular\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Huinnyeoul Culture Village</p>Huinnyeoul Culture Village may look like a rustic and plain village, but it also has its own charm. You can appreciate the warm sunset anywhere in any of the alleys facing the sea. Located on the cliff, it is well known as one of the few places where you can enjoy a magnificent view of the setting sun without obstacles. When the sun, passing through Namhangdaegyo Bridge, turns the sky red over the ridge, even electric wire and wall-mounted clotheslines become beautiful objects. Although the glow of the setting sun reflected in the calm coastal waters of Yeongdo dazzles you, you wouldn’t want to miss any moment. This is because the sunset of Huinnyeoul Culture Village creates a landscape that you’d want to hold in your heart for a long time, rather than through a lens.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Eulsukdo Island</p>The sunset of the Nakdonggang River is also a must-see. Eulsukdo Island, located downstream from the Nakdonggang River, features a calm and peaceful sunset. In winter, migratory birds in the Nakdonggang River and Eulsukdo Island add to the wonderful sunset. The reed beds and silver grass communities in the wetlands blend in with the migratory birds, all of which are drenched in the golden glow of the setting sun. Another fantastic scene is the glowing sunset slowly disappearing behind migratory birds leisurely swimming and diving into the river. What place in the world would be as peaceful as the sunset of Eulsukdo Island? Standing against the setting sun on Eulsukdo Island, you become part of nature.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Busan provides various night views city lights, bridge lights over the sea, lit up skyscrapers, and tons of lights that dot the mountainside road. Let’s  go on a tour around the romantic night view spots full of Busan’s unique colors.\nFirst, let’s visit Hwangnyeongsan Observatory, following the colorful transmitting towers and the different lights around the observatory. The night view seen from the mountains is fascinating. Hwangnyeongsan Observatory provides the best panoramic view of the eastern, western, northern, and southern parts of Busan all at once. This observatory encompasses multifarious night views ranging from spectacular lighting emitted by towering buildings in downtown areas to the subtle scenery filled with colorful lights beneath the foot of the mountain. Headlights of cars moving smoothly on the roads through buildings also show the vitality of the city.\nOne of Busan’s unique night views is the lights of a village along a mountainside road. This is a history diorama that embraces the Busanhang Port and Hocheon Village, boasting such an amazing night view and featured in numerous dramas. Centered around the mountainside road, back-to-back houses are densely packed in here, along with narrow alleys in between. The orange color emitted by street lamps in the alleys gives us a nostalgic, romantic feeling. Moreover, the night view of the mountainside road in harmony with the roof colors such as green, white, and blue presents another beauty different from the splendor of the road.\nThe night view of Gwangandaegyo Bridge is also a must-see. Along Gwangalli Beach, you can see city lights behind you and countless illuminations in front of you. Gwangandaegyo Bridge is where the colorful lighting changes from moment to moment, embellishing the sea at night while people in groups enjoy the entrancing feast of the lights. As a representative beach downtown, it is characterized by vibrant harmony between the energy of people and the lights reflecting from the sea.\nDon’t miss the night view of Busanhangdaegyo Bridge, which connects Yeongdo and the mainland. Busanhangdaegyo Bridge, viewed from Cheonghak Reservoir, emits different lights every moment. The lights of the dock against a backdrop of city lights will surely take your breath away. What if you come close and look up at Busanhangdaegyo Bridge instead of watching it in the distance? The bridge, looked up at from Cheonghak Waterside Park located directly below it, creates a more exceptional view when contrasted with the dark night sky.\nThe night view of Haeundae Beach gives you different emotions depending on the viewing spots. From Mipo, located on the left side of the beach, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Haeundae that embraces all the lights emitting from buildings behind the sea. Dongbaekseom Island, Marine City, and Gwangandaegyo Bridge in the distance come into sight all at once. The bay 101, located at the entrance to Dongbaekseom Island, is a famous spot for a night view of skyscrapers. You can also enjoy a glass of beer while facing the splendid buildings of Marine City. Marine City’s skyscrapers and the reflection in the sea create a picturesque landscape.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "The Donghae Line is a railway line connecting Bujeon Station in Busanjin-gu to Ilgwang Station in Gijang-gun. Prior to the Donghae Line, people had significant difficulty traveling by public transportation from downtown Busan to Ilgwang. However, the Donghae Line allows people to access Gijang and Ilgwang within about 30 min, thus giving more options to enjoy Busan attractions. Let’s find Busan attractions along the Donghae Line.\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Recommended Route</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Bujeon Market (Bujeon Station)  - Oncheoncheon Café Street (Allak Station)  - Songjeong Beach (Sonjeong Station)  - Jukseong Catholic Church (Gijang Station) - Ilgwang Beach (Ilgwang Station)</p>\n<p class=\"font-size23 colorDarkBlue bold\">Bujeon Market (Bujeon Station)</p>Let’s first meet at the Bujeon Market at Bujeon Station, the starting point of the Donghae Line. A combination of eight markets and Bujeon Market is also called Bujeon Market Town. This cluster is so large that it feels like a small town. Bujeon Market lacks nothing. Above all, the best part of the traditional market lies in its variety of food. It serves numerous dishes, including all kinds of fruits, roasted chestnuts, roasted sweet potatoes, fish cake, carp bread, spicy rice cakes, blood sausage, fritters, etc. Why not fill your stomach at Bujeon Market before taking the Donghae Line tour in earnest?\n<p class=\"font-size23 colorDarkBlue bold\">Oncheoncheon Café Street (Allak Station)</p>Walking about 10 min from Allak Station, you’ll see the Oncheoncheon Stream, a rest area for Busan citizens. Take a walk down Oncheoncheon Café Street along the Oncheoncheon stream. This café street is lined with different cafés and shops mainly serving brunch items. After strolling along the well-maintained trail on the streamside, why not refresh yourself with brunch and a cup of coffee?\n<p class=\"font-size23 colorDarkBlue bold\">Songjeong Beach (Songjeong Station) </p>The next stop is Songjeong Station via Centum City from Allak Station. Walking 20 min from Songjeong Station, you’ll reach Songjeong Beach. Songjeong Beach is not that crowded except for the Membership Training (MT) season for university students, allowing you to feel the charm of the serene sea. It’s also a good idea to have toast sold by one of the small vans on the beachfront or relax in a café with a nice view. Jukdo Park located at the edge of the beach has a short walking trail through the pine forest. You can enjoy an unobstructed sea view here from the Songiljeong Pavilion. Songjeong Beach is an excellent venue for those who want to enjoy small pleasures on a secluded beach.\n<p class=\"font-size23 colorDarkBlue bold\">Jukseong Catholic Church (Gijang Station)</p>In 20 min by bus from Gijang Station, you’ll see a unique, picturesque building in a small seaside town. Sitting at the end of a rock facing the sea, Jukseong Catholic Church was built as a filming location for dramas. However, its exotic beauty blending in with the beautiful coastal waters of Gijang attracts many people who want to make unforgettable memories. Every corner of the church in harmony with the dark blue sea serves as a photo zone.\n<p class=\"font-size23 colorDarkBlue bold\">Ilgwang Station (Ilgwang Beach)</p>Walking 10 min from Ilgwang Station, the last stop of the Donghae Line, you’ll reach Ilgwang Beach. The crescent-shaped beach seems to embrace the sea warmly. With its shallow water level, it’s a perfect place to go on a waterside excursion with your family. You can experience various marine sports when the beach is open and also enjoy seaside camping at the campsite.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Some people say that it’s the sea’s job to create waves. However, what matters is that we’re able to wipe all our worries away just by watching the sea work its magic. Unlike summer, the winter sea exemplifies tranquility and respite by itself. People, who once filled the shores last summer have disappeared like the ebbing tide. The days of the hustle and bustle are gone, and the beach has now reclaimed its serenity. This is the best time to enjoy the charms of the sea to the fullest.\nWith the salty scent dance with the sea breeze, the wide beach beckons at a distance like a golden carpet. Walk up to the shore, where the waves crumble and slink away far and wide. Then, when you find yourself missing them, take a few steps toward the sea, and let the waves crash against your feet. Haeundae Beach is filled with people who dance with the waves, their steps closing in yet skipping away like the days when they meet their first love for the very first time. Also, the beach’s strong wind keeps the seagulls at bay. When you stand next to these birds at a distance, you find yourself running after them, breathless in pursuit of these seabirds. With seagulls flying over the beach, with their wings spread out, replacing the sound of the waves, another curve is added to the horizon beyond the beach.\nPeople can’t completely enjoy these sights by simply looking at them. That’s because the tranquil sight of the beach takes on a sentimental moment with lovers, playful spiritedness with friends, and quiet comfort with families. They stare out into the distance, trying to capture the flow of the waves in their memories. The final ceremony in Haeundae is to express these memories through the photographs as many have done before.\nAfter they have the fill of the beach, they can look elsewhere. What makes Haeundae so special is how easy it is to enjoy the sea in multiple directions. People are free to take whichever path they wish to take. Going to the Dongbaekseom Island takes them to the red blooming fields, standing as the first heralds of spring, while the shore to the north takes them to the most dramatic hidden places in Busan. Only the uninformed or the uncaring uses Haeundae as the final stop on their trip.\nNext to the skyscrapers of Haeundae lies the homely Mipo Port, the starting point of the remaining railroad connecting Mipo with Cheongsapo and Gudeokpo Ports after the closing of the Donghae Nambu Line. The roads follow the railroads behind the coastal cliffs, inviting the visitors into the scenery right out of a postcard. The sea rumbles below, seemingly ready to catch everything that the world has to offer in its bosom. Sunlight catching on the waves of a slow afternoon creates silverly reflections, punctuated by a distant sight of a ship that anchors one to the spot.\nOnce you leave the breathtaking scenery, you’ll be by the roads once again. Shortly after that, you’ll arrive at Cheognsapo Port, where the pure white and passionate red lighthouses stand side by side. Many fishers have already picked out their spots. With many rocks jutting out to the sea, Cheongsapo Port is a highly popular fishing spot throughout the year. When the mackerel season comes around in fall, the area becomes the gathering point of many fishers from all over the country.\nNestled across the alleyways of Cheongsapo port town are quirky cafés highly recognized as date spots with many murals that adorn the village walls. Upon walking along these narrow alleys, people find hidden yet intimate pictures of fishing villages. The gates are open without any fear of the unknown, the warmth of the people’s lives unfold between the doors, and the neighborhood puppy stares at the outlander with curious eyes.\nOutside Cheongsapo Port lies Daritdol Observatory. This elevated platform has people’s knees tremble at the sight of transparent floors, 20 m above sea level. As you take a few steps, you’ll see the crashing waves far below. You’ll realize that the sturdiness of the platform keeps you safe and that the experience is like walking on air.\nAs the breeze from the south sweeps across your face, the wind passes by your ears and goes upward. Turn to Cheongsapo Port and Haeundae, and find the curtain of light falling that you saw from a distance.\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Ah, Busan! There are so many things to see, so many places to visit. When in doubt, start off from the gateway to Busan at Busan Station. Walking outside the station and crossing the street brings you to Busan Chinatown and Texas Street. Just a short walk away lies Choryang Ibagu-gil, the living, breathing monument to the modern history of Busan and Korea. Like the story of Ariadne and the Labyrinth, Choryang Ibagu-gil leads the travelers into the mazes of the shantytown, into the past of the city.\nChoryang Ibagu-gil is an urban hiking course and a prime destination to experience the stories, traditions, and the lives of Busan’s past. This 2 km long–road starts off at the former Baekje Hospital and leads to Kkakkomak, the location of Ebagu Archive Center. Ibagu is the word for “story” in the Gyeongsang dialect, which suggests what the visitor would find on the road.\nThe road starts at the former Baekje Hospital. This building, which is about 60–70 years old, was used by the Imperial Japanese Army and the US Army in the past. Today’s building houses design shops and galleries. People can find right next to the building the traces of Namseon Warehouse, which used to store dried pollacks brought from Hamgyeong-do before the opening of the Gyeongwon Line.\nThe road then slowly begins to climb upward into a narrow alley, which leads to the Mural Alley. Looking at the photographs and poems on display brings people the images of displaced refugees and laborers starting and ending their days on this hill. Faded black-and-white photographs testify to the fear of the displaced refugees and the difficult times back then, bringing visitors one step closer to the past.\nIn front of the Dong-gu Inmulsa (Famous Figures) Wall stands Choryang Church, where former President Rhee Syngman  used to attend during the Korean War. This is the first protestant church to be established south of the Hangang River in 1892 and is known to have played a significant role in the March First Independence Movements in Busan.\nThis is the place where the shantytown part of the Choryang Ibagu-gil Road begins. The neighborhood and its maze-like collection of alleys seem to exist in its own bubble, almost like a movie set. Moreover, the scenery of the area testifies to the hard times of the 1970s and the 1980s. Following the Ibagu-gil Road, people can witness the unfolding of history, from its start as mountainside shantytowns built by the war refugees during the Korean War to its expansion as the housing sites of laborers working in the docks later on.\nLastly, people can finally make out a silhouette of a staircase standing nearly vertically at a distance: 168 Stairs. Gasps and gaping faces surround the stairs, especially from those who remember the times when these sights were common. Below the stairs, they find a well, which is said to have served 400 people in the surrounding areas and still survives to this day. The grandfathers and fathers who used to live in these small houses standing shoulder-by-shoulder next to one another are believed to have jumped off the stairs whenever the rumble of a foghorn reached the neighborhood. After all, a ship entering the port meant that they had some work. A funicular system serves today’s 168 Stairs. The sleek funicular running next to the old stairs of memories is the stark contrast between the past and present of Busan.\n\nIbagu-gil Road now passes around the Kim Minbu Viewing Point and Dangsan, leading into the mountainside road. This decked road takes the visitors in a wide loop around the mountain. It is a great place to enjoy the view of the Busanhang Port, so the road feels like a part of the trip, rather than a connection. The next stop on the Ibagu-gil Road is the Yoo Chihwan Postbox. Standing in front of this slow postbox, which sends every letter that it receives a year later from the day it was written, people can’t help but wonder at the beautiful scenery of the Port of Busan and the mountains that surround the port like natural curtains.\nPeople realize that time has shaped Busan away from the tragedy of the war and the difficult times during the economic development into something else—this dynamic and new Busan, where culture and history throbs with life, was the result of that process.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Perhaps, it can be defined as the “rediscovery of a space partitioned by invisible lines.” Markets and youngster hangouts are bordered by a single street, and old canteens and sleek restaurants share the same alley. Different places have different age groups and cater to them in different ways. But there are no impassable barriers—there are different hangouts, and the only problem is choosing where to hang out this time. But even within this intensely dynamic place, Jeonpo Cafe Street remains the hottest place today. Rumors of this charismatic and unique place have already reached other countries: New York Times selected Jeonpo Cafe Street as one of the “52 Places to Go in 2017.”\nThe alleyway next to Seomyeon’s Norimaru, which signals the beginning of the Jeonpo Cafe Street, is characterized by the ideal combination of the old and new buildings. The scenery of this place showcases its New-tro philosophy to the fullest, exemplified in its combination of old buildings with modern touches. Even the new buildings stand unique without harming the harmony of the area. Such coexistence of the old tool shops with new restaurants and cafés is one of the biggest charms of this area.\n\nThe alley itself is an exercise in the culinary diversity of the world. One corner has the unmistakably elegant blend of spices from Indian curries, while the next alley takes one to Thailand’s fresh scents. Lounging further along the alley are French and Italian restaurants. The dishes that only existed in tourist guidebooks are shaped into reality in these alleys.\n\nOnce satisfied with the meal, the next step is to relocate to many dessert cafés of the neighborhood. The burden of choice is very much alive in this case as well. From cafés furnished lovingly with teddy bears to clear display cases that barely hide the luster of sumptuous cakes within, walking down the Jeonpo Cafe Street is a terrible experience for the indecisive. Giving up is not an option; however, where else in Busan would one find the perfect café to spend a lazy afternoon in?\n\nThose who prefer something more unique, or those who are not satisfied with the dynamic atmosphere of Jeonpo Cafe Street, only need to cross a road toward Busanjin Fire Station. There are four alleys that somehow feel similar to Jeonpo Cafe Street but are actually different—the Jeollidangil Street area, the hangout for those who dance on the cutting edge of style. This area is home to a large collection of restaurants, cafés, ateliers, nail shops, vintage fashion shops, photographer’s studios, and leather workshops—all united in their pursuit of uniqueness and industrial-retro interior. It feels a bit older and rougher than its more popular sibling, giving an air of a rebellious individualism that clashes with the relatively tame areas that surround it.\n\nThis sense of tension is what makes Jeollidangil Street so dynamic. Old and run-down tool shops and machine workshops intersect with the shops on the cutting edge of fashion, generating a strange sense of rhythm that pulses throughout the neighborhood. It feels as if the past and the present are meeting like cogs in a machine here, grinding along to create the icons of tomorrow’s culture.\nThe common charm of these two alleyways is the freshness of the space generated by the fusion between unexpected spaces. They are also spaces that offer a wide range of cultural experiences in compressed forms but refrain from forcing a choice to its visitors; they are free and young spaces.\nThe rays of the sun drifting between the buildings have left the area unnoticed. The dusk scrambles hastily into the corners. Some are closing down the shutters; others are lighting the bulbs for the night. The first act of Jeonpo Cafe Street and Jeollidangil Street closes. There is no intermission until the second act.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "At first, there were points, which then people connected two lonely dots with a bridge. These dots became a line, thus creating a new road. Once the distance between the two points was connected, the people of the two points were finally able to meet anytime and bridge their longing for each other. Busan’s bridges are the children of love and longing for the lonely and the missed. Perhaps, that’s why the gigantic structures of steel and concrete seem to beat with the warmth of the heart. When the night falls, such warmth turns into brilliant colors that create dazzling sceneries of dancing light. We set out in search of the bridges that make Busan what it is.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Yeongdodaegyo and Busandaegyo Bridges </p>Yeongdodaegyo and Busandaegyo Bridges stand like siblings as they bridge the district of Jung-gu with Yeongdo. Yeongdo Bridge was the first drawbridge in Korea, and one of the symbols of Busan. It also served as the meeting point for many of the displaced war refugees during the Korean War. Next to it stands Busandaegyo Bridge, which was built in 1980. The best time to see the two bridges side by side is at 2:00 p.m., the only time of the day when Yeongdodaegyo Bridge is lifted. Moreover, the best point to watch them is the Yurari Square beside Jagalchi Market and the rooftop observation deck at the Lotte Department Store Gwangbok Branch. Yeongdodaegyo Bridge and the Busandaegyo Bridge themselves also make good places to watch the other side.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Gwangandaegyo Bridge </p>One of the landmarks of Busan, Gwangandaegyo Bridge can be seen from Gwangalli Beach, Haeundae, or Waterside Park. As the largest double-layer bridge in Korea, Gwangandaegyo Bridge inspires with its massive presence. The upper deck of the bridge offers a panoramic view of the unbelievably beautiful seas of Busan, the Oryukdo Islets just out of arm’s reach, and the elegant perch of Dongbaekseom Island next to the Haeundae Beach. Gwangandaegyo Bridge is also known for its breathtaking light shows involving more than 100,000 colors each night. Gwangalli Beach is the best place to enjoy this light show. Once the night arrives, many people flock to the beach to witness the beauty of the bridge at night. Others opt to take a yacht to appreciate Gwangandaegyo Bridge completely.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Namhangdaegyo Bridge </p>Bridging the Amnam-dong area of Seo-gu and Yeongseon-dong area of Yeongdo-gu, Namhangdaegyo Bridge was established to facilitate the transportation of goods between Pusan Newport and North Port. A walking trail is established on the bridge, allowing the visitors an expansive view over the area surrounding the South Port of Busan. At night, the trail lights up with 2,500 LED lights, which has established the trail as one of the new sites for night views in Busan. The best place to see the Namhangdaegyo Bridge is the Bongnaesan Mountain (395 m) of Yeongdo. A short climb along the excellently paved hiking trail makes the climb a breeze for anyone. Yeongdo’s Huinnyeoul Culture Village or the South Port Embankment are good points as well. Amnam Park also offers a view from a different angle along with its beautiful cliffs.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Busanhangdaegyo Bridge</p>Busanhangdaegyo Bridge is a powerful presence in front of Busanhang Port. Connecting Yeongdo-gu with Nam-gu, this is considered one of the most prominent bridges in Busan, along with Gwangandaegyo Bridge. Its diamond-shaped tower is the biggest draw of the bridge, and the way it illuminates in the colors of the rainbow in a sunset, adding a figurative icing to the beautiful cake that is the Port of Busan. To get the best view of the bridge, one could go to the mountainside road in Yeongdo, Sinki Forest Café, or Cheonghak Reservoir. Emerging out of the Busan Station and following the Ibagu-gil Road allows one an expansive view of the Port of Busan and the Busanhangdaegyo Bridge too. For an even more dramatic view, take the road to Gubongsan Mountain (404 m) from Ibagu-gil Road.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Eulsukdodaegyo Bridge</p>Eulsukdodaegyo Bridge crosses the beautiful Nakdonggang Estuary. Unlike most bridges, Eulsukdodaegyo Bridge takes the form of a soft curve, a feature that was added to accommodate Eulsukdo Island, one of the largest sites for migratory birds in East Asia. Eulsukdo Eco Park is the best place to see what Eulsukdo Island and Eulsukdodaegyo Bridge have to offer. The Eco Park provides an exhibition on the natural environment of Nakdonggang Estuary, which prompts visitors to think about what it truly means for humans to coexist with nature. For a more three-dimensional view of the Eulsukdodaegyo Bridge, go to Myeongji Ocean City coastal trail. Walking the trail brings one to a perfect picture of Nakdonggang Estuary, encompassing the migratory bird sites of Nakdonggang River, Eulsukdo Island, and the Eulsukdodaegyo Bridge in a single frame.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Geogadaegyo Bridge</p>With a construction cost of KRW 1.5 trillion, Geogadaegyo Bridge connects Gadeokdo Island of Busan and Geojedo Island of South Gyeongsang Province. Geogadaegyo Bridge passes through Gadeokdo, Daejukdo, Jungjukdo, Jeodo Islands, and Yuho-ri area, cutting down the distance between Busan and Geojedo Island from 140 km to 60 km in the process. The construction of this bridge created a fantastic coastal drive course from Busan to Geoje and Tongyeong. Moreover, the best place to appreciate the majesty of the bridge itself is at the Yeondaebong Peak of Gadeokdo Island. Reaching the Yeondaebong Peak requires two-hour trekking, but the view is definitely worth it. Moreover, you’ll appreciate the view of the Geogadaegyo Bridge when you reach the sunset, which like the long note of good-quality chocolate, leaves a long, moving note in one’s heart. Gadeokhaean-ro, a coastal road connecting the Cheonseon-dong area with Cheonseonhang Port, is also a perfect place to enjoy the view of the Geogadaegyo Bridge.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Although May is first thought as the month for families, it is also the season of roses with various meanings in the language of flowers.\nLet us find out the best rose gardens hidden on every corner of Busan.\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Hwamyeong Rose Park</p>The first place that comes to mind when people think of roses in Busan is Hwamyeong Rose Village. It is also called Hwamyeong Rose Park or Hwamyeong Rose Garden, which is a 10 min walk from Hwamyeong Station on the Busan Metro.\nHwamyeong Rose Park consists of 50 different types of roses, which have their own meanings in the language of flowers. Knowing each meaning heightens one’s appreciation for roses. Red roses mean love and passion, yellow roses symbolize friendship and eternal love, and white roses signify purity and innocence. Each rose section shows the names, colors, breeding countries, years, and types of roses, which will allow visitors to enjoy the biological information of the flowers.\nWhile observing lotus flowers, frogs, and turtles in the pond, you can take unforgettable pictures in the photo zones in places within the rose fences. You will surely experience new pleasure in the tour around Busan.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">UN Memorial Cemetery in Korea</p>UN Memorial Cemetery in Korea (UNMCK), which contains the graves of the fallen soldiers and war veterans from 21 participating countries in the Korean War, attracts many tourists because of its historical value. Every May, in particular, UNMCK is transformed into a rose park filled with floral fragrances, as it allows us to remember the soldiers’ and veterans’ noble sacrifice for the country. Looking at the colorful roses blooming sorrowfully between the gravestones, you may think of the cemetery’s meaning more deeply than ever. \nRoses in UNMCK are not that diverse, but they feature wider and larger petals, creating different sceneries compared to other rose parks. In spring, the cherry blossoms surrounding UNMCK are in full bloom, and the chrysanthemum festival takes place in autumn. On the other hand, the botanical garden is where green plants can be observed in all seasons. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Jeonggwan Rose Park (Witgol Park/ Gumokjeong Park)</p>Witgol Park is another rose park that is next to the Jeonggwan Children’s Library. In spring, children alongside their mothers are often seen around the park, as they walk hand in hand. As different types of roses are scattered in the open park, it turns into a rose park, where everyone can enjoy and smell the rich fragrances of roses born on the spring breeze in May. \nIf you want to see more different kinds of roses, head over to Gumokjeong Park across the bridge, where you can see 144 types of roses, 32 of which were first introduced in Korea. The garden is well decorated, so you can perfectly relax with your family at the lawn square in the middle of the park. Thanks to its well-established dullegil (trail), it’s a perfect venue for strolls and outings. \nThe rose tunnel is one of its most popular photo zones. It is recommended to visit the park in June when the roses are in full bloom. Another way to enjoy the park is by visiting it during the evening as the lights show off a different beauty in the roses.\nIn May, you have opportunities to spend more time with your family. \nIf you have missed spring activities because of your hectic schedule, don’t worry!\nThe roses of Busan are waiting for you. Head out and visit the famous gardens teeming with diverse types of colorful roses that have significant meanings in the language of flowers.\n\n\n"

Here is some of the healing locations on my healing bucket list.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Herbrang Forest</p>The first place that I thought of was Herbrang, a secret forest known where located at the foot of Geumjeongsan Mountain. \nIt is a beautiful garden situated in this mysterious forest. For over 30 years, the owner planted various types of trees and flowers as it grew with love and care.\nThe entrance is marked by two cute engraved rabbits as if they are waiting for Alice to enter Wonderland. Meanwhile, little Alices, who are searching the forest as if they’re looking for a four-leaf clover, can be found at the start of the path.\nHinoki cypress trees are lined on either sides of the road and birds sing harmonic between the branches. Moreover, small light bulbs and sweet phrases are hanging around to make your heart flutter. With its unique forest-friendly structure, there is a cafe named Herbteria which serves homegrown herbal tea, coffee and oven-baked pizza. You able to sit at the outdoor table to enjoy the aroma of herbs around with a refresh and healing experience. \nHerbrang is also a popular outdoor wedding venue with its fairytale-like atmosphere that feels as you are enjoying a picnic. What a beautiful sight where you can become a fairytale character at Herbrang with the aroma of green plants and flowers around.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Coastal trail in front of the Gijang Hilton Hotel</p>Gijang’s blue ocean is a must-see to enjoy a healing time. The coastal trail in front of the Gijang Hilton Hotel is a great place to spend a relaxing afternoon. Furthermore, the wind around coastal trail is just nice and perfect for walks. Stroll back and forth from one end to another with a couple of times for exercise while pause for few moments to enjoy the beautiful scenery from the coastal trail.\nGijang’s coastline that can be seen from the trail features an infinitely deep emerald ocean. The sound of waves splashing against rocks on the shore adds a more refreshing experience as you walk and admire the view. \nA yellow minibus is parked by the outdoor terrace in front of the trail. Grab a cup of coffee to feel like the king of the world. There’s much to do even if you’re alone. You can watch the dogs that come out for walks, feel jealous of couples that stroll hand in hand, and enjoy a healing time on your own as well.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Oncheoncheon Café Street</p>Featuring with beautiful and unique cafe and restaurants, Oncheoncheon Cafe street is an alley that consists of old houses filled with vintage concept where by the Oncheoncheon stream gently flows. The place is cannot be skipped when the weather is nice. In Spring, flowers are in full bloomed while greens cover the area by giving a refresh energy during summer. In fall, dainty reeds wave in welcome while you can enjoy the white snows covered Oncheoncheon stream in winter if you are lucky. As such, you can walk on wooden decks to look at the Oncheoncheon stream by watching people pass by. At last, you also can enjoy the golden sun falling on your shoulders as well as the cool breeze to end your healing day.\n\nI feel relaxed as I watching the gently flowing stream, counting the step stones and cross over to the other side of stream.\n\nLet's stop by a cafe that you liked wile walking along the alley where you have not been to make your travel experience more special one.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Allow me to introduce you to a simple way to go out using minimal equipment at a time when traveling is not really an option. I’m talking about car-camping and car-picnicking. Sleeping inside the car without a tent and picnicking in the car are new ways to enjoy travel as long as you can find a place to park the car. The great thing about these two traveling methods is that you can simply enjoy nature in your own space without anyone to interfere.\nLet’s head over to the hidden gems of Busan where you can enjoy car-camping (car-picnicking) and take photos of lasting memories. \n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">#1. Gorgeous Sunrise at Mundong Embankment</p>\nEarly morning when it is still dark, I am heading over to Mundong Embankment, a sunrise destination known to only a few. A couple of camping vehicles were already strategically parked when I arrived. After thinking for a while, I parked on a spot that oversaw the two lighthouses.\n\nEven though it was early, residents who were beginning their daily work greeted me as they walked by. “Have you come to see the sunrise? Take beautiful pictures!” Their kind words made me grow more expectant.\nThe sky started to turn into a shade of pink as if sunrise were about to happen. Unlike the weather forecast, which predicted cloudy weather, the sky looked even nicer, thanks to some clouds.\n\nLying inside my car with a blanket over me and enjoying the cool ocean breeze made me wonder if this wasn’t heaven itself. I drank a cup of fragrant tea from using the hot water that I brought in a thermos bottle and sat on the embankment to take a selfie. It would have been nicer had I come with someone else, but being alone has its own beauty.\nThe sun is rising from the lighthouse on the right. The golden sky is reflected on the ocean. As I watched the sea, I was able to empty my thoughts with the sound of the wave as the background music.\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Address</p>Search for Mundong Embankment on the map\nThe address for the spot with the two lighthouses in the picture is 629, Munoseong-gil, Ilgwang-myeon, Gijang-gun, Busan, Republic of Korea.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Tip</p>Try to be quiet as it is the entrance to a residential village. \nSimple cooking may be possible, but make sure to clean up after yourself!\nRestroom is available.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">#2. Samnak Eco Park to Enjoy Green Wherever You Park</p>\nThere is a place where you can enjoy greenness no matter where you park. It is no other than Samnak Eco Park in Sasang-gu, Busan. The park is the largest marshland by the mouth of the Nakdonggang River and a leading park of Busan with diverse natural environments and convenience facilities. People are most familiar with the cherry blossom road in April, but the park has more flowers and greenness in May and June. Samnak Eco Park has many parking lots, and the beautiful scenery can be enjoyed inside the car no matter where you park.\nI head over to Samnak Eco Park on a sunny summer day with a simple lunchbox. As there are many friendly street cats here, I also packed some cat snacks. Despite it being a weekday, many residents of Busan visited to use the convenience facilities of the park. The parking lot is packed, but I scan around for a spot to enjoy car-picnicking like a pro.\n\nThe place I ended up parking at is a “temporary parking lot” that does not even have a name. I went to the side of the temporary parking lot, and it was relaxing with a few people and a tranquil view.\nI walked around with my car parked. As I walked along the trail with trees lined up, even the chair by the side felt like it was out of a movie. I looked around. Then, I took some pictures seated. It is a true blessing to have such a beautiful park in the city. Next time, I would like to stay longer and discover hidden spots inside the Samnak Eco Park.\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Address</p>Search for Samnak Eco Park on the map.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Tip</p>The Samnak Eco Park houses the Samnak Auto Campground. If you want to stay overnight or it planning on cooking, please use the campground.\nLeisurely drive around to discover a place to enjoy car-picnicking as each parking lot has a scenic view\nRestroom is available.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">#3. Dadaepo Beach Where You Can See a Fantastic Sunset</p>\nDadaepo Beach is the place people think of when they want to see the sunset in Busan. Car-camping and car-picnicking are also available at Dadaepo Beach.\nI was concerned that people would stare because I have a cute blanket inside the car and a pretty light outside the car, but they did not. People were instead focused on their own walks and outings. The spot that I chose for car-picnicking was the public parking lot of Dadaepo Beach. It was so much fun to view the ocean and watch the people pass by.\n\nThe perfect time for watching the sunset at Dadaepo Beach in early summer is at 18:00. As the sun set, the field was coated with light. At willing to miss such an opportune moment, brides and grooms taking their wedding photos, photographers who wanted to take pictures of the reed, and those who wanted to share the great experience gathered.\nAs the initial spot did not offer a view of the sunset, I parked in a different direction. This was possible because I was on a car-picnicking that did not involve a tent. I was able to enjoy a peacefully retired sunset inside the car in a leisurely manner.\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Parking</p>Search for Dadaepo Beach Public Parking Lot on the map.\nPark with the view of the ocean at the innermost spot of the parking lot. \nThe sun sets in the direction seen in the photo, so pick a different spot if you want to see the sunset inside the car.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Tip</p>Cooking prohibited.\nRestroom is available. Separate garbage recycling available.\nAll-day parking fee is KRW 8,000.\n\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "The Busan Environmental Corporation(Haeundae Office) is not a popular spot, but it is a scenic and nature-friendly hot spot perfect for taking a walk in Busan!\nThe Busan Environment Corporation Haeundae Office is situated in Haeundae-gu, Busan. A few walking courses are available starting at the Busan Environmental Corporation. The course we would like to introduce today starts at the Busan Environment Corporation and passes by Gogh’s Road (Metasequoia Road) and the Old Songjeong Road onto the Deck Observatory.\nThe departure point for this walking course is the Busan Environment Corporation. It has a parking lot, so you can conveniently park here. Next to the corporation is an environmental park, and inside the park is a clean pond.\nSmall lotus leaves in the size of the palm gently floats around the water. \nFancy carps swim around to welcome people. Next to the pond is a colorful pavilion for passersby to take a break. Appreciate the lake and catch a breath here.\n\n\nWalk further into the environmental park to see the Metasequoia Road. The street covered with trees on either side is also known as Gogh’s Road. People frequently visit the flat tree-lined road that stretches out over 200 m with children and pets, and take wonderful pictures.\n\n\nGogh’s Road has recently gained the nickname of “insider” road of Haeundae. Young people visit to take amazing photos of themselves. Straight Metasequoia trees lined up to either side of the road appear like dignified soldiers standing in a line. The scenery of the tree-lined street changes by season. Capture the greenness of spring, the thick forest of the summer, redness of fall and solitude of the winter in a snapshot.\nIn summer, Metasequoia trees densely cover the road, creating a natural oxygen chamber. Moreover, the road becomes quiet and peaceful when the trees are blown by the wind. Walk on the patchy tree shadows to heal the mind and body at once. There is this special pleasure that you can only experience at Gogh’s Road.\n\n\nWhere the Gogh’s Road ends, a mountainous path begins. A natural matt is covered over the ascending road to help people climb easily. Birds in the forest sing songs that praise nature. Take in the fresh air that you cannot enjoy in the busy and loud city.\nSignage guides you whenever there is a divided path in the mountain, but they are written in Korean only so please bring a translator tool!\nWalk about 10 min following the signage to reach the Old Songjeong Road. This is the road that people took to get to the sea of Songjeong from Haeundae in the old days. Before the Songjeong Terminal was built, people used this road to travel to Songjeong. Many Korean people have memories related to the old road. Usage has been limited since the installation of the military depot during the Korean War.\nThe Old Songjeong Road was restored this year and opened to the people since May. Inside the road is a memory shelter. Starting with the Korean War up to 1998, the spot was used as the ammunition warehouse of the army headquarters. Now, it is an abandoned military warehouse that contains the wounds of the war as well as the memories of a generation of people.\n\n\nTake a short break at the Old Songjeong Road, and head up to reach the Deck Observatory. Step up on the observatory, and a fresh breeze of wind will strike you. Then, enjoy the sea of Songjeong in full view. The healing site will erase the difficulties you have experienced until reaching the spot.\nDon’t just stay home when the birds sing and flowers are fragrant! Step outside with family, friends, or lover for a walk! Take in fresh air and comfort your mind and body!\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "We have entered the month of June, which is abundant with the freshness of green. Early this year, the heat has struck the country, and the scorching sun is exhausting us even more as COVID-19 continues to plague our daily lives. At a time like this, people choose to visit the mountains and oceans where it is less likely to come into contact with others. Perhaps everyone is thinking the same way. Hence, the more you travel away from the city, the bigger crowd you encounter. What if we go to a park in the city instead, where social distancing in daily life is practicable? Let us take this opportunity to rediscover the leading parks in the city of Busan with the lens of a traveling writer.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Democracy Park with a Full View of Busan</p>There is a park in Busan that I, a native of Seoul, write down as “the place to visit in Spring.” I’m talking about the Democracy Park in Yeongju-dong, Jung-gu, Busan, known as a famous Prunus donarium cherry blossom destination. The park attracts visitors in April as a hidden gem for taking pictures at the cherry blossom hill that is large for the size of the park. I wonder what the Democracy Park looks like in early summer.\n\nOn a sunny day in June, the Democracy Park was quiet. Green trees created large shades, and flowers and plants that grew in various locations were satisfying to the eyes. You could feel the cool breeze while walking. This might be because the park is situated on a high hill that looks down on the city of Busan from above.\n\nDemocracy Park refers to the grass-covered Jangseung (guardian post) Yard that houses the Democratic Movement Memorial Center at the center. The park also features an exhibition hall, a theater, and an observatory. There is also a trail that surrounds the Democratic Movement Memorial Center. Democratic Struggle Memorial Building\nWe have reached the Democratic Struggle Memorial Building at the center of the park in no time. Unfortunately, the day I visited was a closing day, but just by looking at the size and facilities of the memorial building, we were able to understand the noble value of the place.\n\nIf you walk over to the trail at the back of Democracy Park, you will run into a small Metasequoia Tree Road. Walking between the seemingly small but large trees, you will feel as if being at a vast forest no smaller than the Saryeoni Forest in Jeju Island. Sit by the thoughtfully built bench to take in the fresh energy of the forest.\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Address</p>Search for Democracy Park or Democratic Struggle Memorial Building on the map.\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Tip</p>The Jungang Park public parking lot, which can be accessed before entering Democracy Park, costs KRW 200 for every 10 minutes. Meanwhile, free parking is available for 2 hours in the parking lot inside Democracy Park.\nYou may picnic on the grass if you use a mat, but cooking is strictly prohibited. Restroom is available.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Daesin Park That Features a Hinoki Cypress Forest and Reservoir</p>Daesin Park is located near the Democracy Park. The official name of this park is also Jungang Park, but the residents still refer to the neighborhood park as Daesin park. With its fragrant hinoki cypress scent that welcomes visitors at the entrance, the Hinoki Cypress Forest of Daesin Park received an award from the National Beautiful Forest Contest. The park used to be a controlled space to protect the catchment area, but it is open to all to come and enjoy a therapeutic walk in the forest.\n\nStrolling along Daesin Park, you will spot a glistening reservoir, which will make you wonder if you are in some other country. There are two reservoirs inside Daesin Park. Reservoir 1, which is close to the entrance, has many spots where you can take a rest. You’ll notice as you sit on the bench and gaze at the water that reflects the sunlight that your troubled mind is being sorted out. If you are lucky, you may catch a fountain. So leisurely take a walk, and take advantage of the whole park.\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Address</p>Search for Daesin Park on the map\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Tip</p>The public parking lot outside the entrance of the park is KRW 200 for 10 minutes. You may eat a simple snack on the benches or pavilions, but make sure to clean up after yourself.\nDrinking water, restroom, and snack stand available.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Hwamyeong Arboretum from a Fairytale</p>Hwamyeong Arboretum is the first public arboretum in Busan. It operates a diverse range of forest experience programs and owns a diverse range of plant resources as an ecosystem education venue with plant exhibitions. I parked my car at the lot and stepped into the entrance, letting out a gasp of joy. It was like walking into a scene from a fairytale! The bridge at the entrance was colorful as if crossing it would lead me to a mysterious world. I glanced at the inside and marveled at the large size.\n\nHwamyeong Arboretum consists of a forest exhibition room consisting of six topics including an invitation to the forest, the vitality of the awakening forest, forest in danger, and living and breathing future environment, a glass greenhouse, a needleleaf tree garden, a broadleaf tree garden, a botanic garden, and an aquatic ecosystem garden. The glass greenhouse, which is a scenic place great for taking pictures, was off limits because of COVID-19. Enjoying the wildflowers that bloomed in the great weather was more than enough to console my disappointment.\n\nThe pristine Daecheoncheon Stream flew behind Godangbong Peak of Geumjeongsan Mountain. The water was clear, and the sound of water filled up my ears. I did not know that June was the season of blooming for so many flowers. It was as if all the wildflowers in the world had gathered here. To pay respect to the wildflowers, I pulled out my camera and took some selfies like the other visitors against the wildflower.\nAs the arboretum was located in the middle of the mountain, the sun set fast. If you want to take pictures with the flowers, make sure to visit early.\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Address</p>Search for Hwamyeong Arboretum on the map\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Tip</p>Free parking\nRestroom and drink vending machine available.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "<p class=\"font-size23 colorDarkBlue bold\">The Korean War, An Unforgettable Scar</p>After enduring Japanese occupation, the people of Korea had to face another tragic event called the Korean War before they could even fully enjoy their hard-won independence. While it occurred 70 years ago, to those who experienced the dawn of June 25, 1950, it is a vivid page in the annals of history that continues have a lasting impact.\nThe Korean War began with a surprise attack on South Korea by North Korea. Our army, UN Forces, and young student soldiers had to march to battlegrounds with guns on their back. Within three days of the outbreak of war, Seoul was captured and the North Korean army marched south, occupying all of the land up to the Nakdonggang River. Thanks to the success of the Incheon Landing Operation, we took back Seoul and marched as far north as the Amnokgang (Yalu) River. Due to the intervention of the Chinese Army, however, called the January–Fourth Retreat, the South Korean Army and UN Forces had to step back to the south of the 38th Parallel.\nDuring the three years of the Korean War, Busan became the temporary capital of South Korea with endless lines of incoming refugees. Busan is a city that contains the memories of the refugees who lived scattered about without knowing the whereabouts of their families.\n<p class=\"font-size23 colorDarkBlue bold\">Refugee Capital “Busan”</p>The Provisional Capital Memorial Hall is a building that represents Busan as a refugee capital. Used as the official residence of the president, the two-story red brick building built in western style architecture faithfully reenacts the interior of the guest room and office space. The president and his staff took care of domestic and overseas work here and tried to gain peace of mind in a chaotic time. The exhibition hall displays many materials that reveal the politics, economy, and life of the people of Busan when it was the temporary capital of the country for those 1,023 days. The living room, a space where the employees for the official residence gathered, exhibits the lives of the refugees who lived a hard life at the refugee capital of Busan. It must have been war itself to live in the shanty town and do whatever had to be done to make a living.\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Provisional Capital Memorial Hall</p>Tel. +82-51-244-6345\nAddress: 45, Imsisudoginyeom-ro, Seo-gu, Busan\nHours: 09:00–18:00 \nClosed on: January 1 and Every Monday\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size23 colorDarkBlue bold\">Choryang Ibagu-gil and 168 Stairs</p>Refugees poured into Busan by the thousands and the city was saturated with people. The population, which was 280,000 before the Korean War, increased to 1 million. No wonder there was not enough land for people to live on. Numerous cardboard houses lined up along the slope to the hillside of the city. The Choryang Ibagu-gil was one of the locations with the largest number of people. Check out the 168 stairs, it will make you dizzy. To find work, the refugees had to ascend and descend these stairs many times a day. After a long day’s work, on their way home, a cup of makgeolli (rice wine) must have been of great comfort to the refugees. Currently, a red monorail is in operation. You won’t have to ascend the 168 stairs but how nice it is to find a makgeolli store at the end of the stairs.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size23 colorDarkBlue bold\">Walker House/UN Memorial Cemetery in Korea</p>Walker House is the building that was used as the temporary headquarters by General Walker, the Commander of the Eighth US Army, as he led the Allied Forces operations. Nothing was more important than protecting the Nakdonggang River defense line to the South Korean Army and the Allied Forces who had been pushed down south to the Nakdonggang River by the fierce attacks of the North Korean Army. The Incheon Landing Operation succeeded because the General secured the Nakdonggang River front. Find out more about the life and spirit of General Walker, a relatively unknown hero of the Korean War, at Walker House inside Pukyong National University. \nVisiting the UN Memorial Cemetery in Korea where the souls of veterans from all over the world rest in peace may be a worthy thing to do to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Korean War. The UN Memorial Cemetery in Korea is located within 15 minutes walking distance from the Walker House, allowing easy access. There are seven cemeteries including the cemetery of the Korean Army Veterans, Canadian soldiers, and US soldiers as well as the memorial tower, memorial monument, and memorial hall. Let’s express our gratitude by honoring the souls of war veterans who sacrificed their precious lives to protect South Korea. \n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">Walker House in Pukyong National University</p>45, Yongso-ro, Nam-gu, Busan\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue medium\">UN Memorial Cemetery in Korea</p>UN Memorial Cemetery in Korea\n\nThe Korean War left the Korean Peninsula a mess and scarred South and North Korea in unforgettable ways over three years. Our army fought valiantly under the firm resolution to protect the homeland, and the UN Forces bravely fought to protect the people of a country that was, to them, unknown, mysterious, and far away. We thank them for their sacrifice and dedication.\nWe will “remember” their noble spirit and protect the “peace” that we enjoy “together.”\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Skateboarding is an original extreme sport. In the late 50s and early 60s, surfing evolved into skateboarding and continued to advance, later becoming a great sport that is loved by people around the world. Skateboards can be divided into basic and long types. Once in a while, you get to see amazing skaters riding across the streets or in universities. However, finding a spot where you can leisurely enjoy skateboarding can be tough. It is also more difficult to find good skateboarding spots for foreigners. Thus, we introduce a couple of good places where the skateboarders who need places to practice can enjoy the vibe and leisurely skateboard.\n\n<p class=\"font-size23 colorDarkBlue bold\">Busan Cinema Center</p>Busan Cinema Center is located in the bustling streets of Haeundae-gu, which is famous worldwide as the town that hosts the Busan International Film Festival (BIFF). But foreign tourists probably don’t know that this place is also the largest skateboarding spot in Busan.\nYou can see individual skaters, skateboarding clubs, as well as foreigners frequenting Busan Cinema Center. Skateboards that people ride also differ by type. Some use basic skateboards, others prefer long ones, while some choose cruiser skateboards and various types.\nThe Busan Cinema Center is the largest skateboarding spot because it is not only situated in a crowded area with a nice view but providing a wide space for skateboarding and lighting that is turned on until 11:00 p.m. There is even a roof to shelter skateboarders when it rains.\nYoung students and beginners enjoy skateboarding in the area, as this is where famous teachers hold skateboarding lectures.\nMoreover, it is charming during the day but more brilliant and gorgeous at night as the flashy lighting, which comes in different colors and shapes that shine over the area, makes skateboarders riding like the wind look extra cool when spotlighted. If you are traveling to Korea from abroad, you should drop by Busan’s hottest spot and take photos with your skateboard!\nOn weekdays and weekends, skateboard masters and other skilled people gather at Busan Cinema Center. If you want to learn how to skateboard, you should come and hang out in the area to make friends and learn tricks at the same time.\n\nBusan Cinema Center: 120, Suyeonggangbyeon-daero, Haeundae-gu, Busan\nWalk for 5 min from Exit 6 of Centum City Station on Busan Metro Line 2\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size23 colorDarkBlue bold\">Namhang Waterside Park</p>Namhang Waterside Park is another famous skateboarding spot in Busan. The great thing about this place is that geography is not complicated, which means even beginning skateboarders can ride well. The track here is wide and long, which is friendly for beginners. \nThe Waterside Park is also spacious with a flat floor, making it a great practice place for beginners who have difficulties finding a flat ground. That’s why the skateboarding clubs frequently visit this venue.\nYoung students riding skateboards or inline skates look very serious with their good postures, and their faces beam with joy as they ride from one end to another. Practice well and become great skateboarders who will pierce the sky!\n\nNamhang Waterside Park: 141-218, Namhang-dong 3(sam)-ga, Yeongdo-gu, Busan\nTake off Bus 508, 6, 7, 70, 71, 82, 85, 9 at Busan Healthcare High School and walk for 7 min\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size23 colorDarkBlue bold\">Myeongnyun Inline Skating Rink</p>The next venue to introduce is an inline skating rink. Everyone interested in inline skating knows about this place located between Myeongnyun Station and Dongnae Station. Take Exit 2 of Myeongnyun Station and walk five min toward Oncheoncheon Stream in the direction of Dongnae to reach the rink. \nThe track here is also on the long side, which is good for riding longboards, and its floor is laid out specifically for inline skating. \nYou can meet people of various ages and levels who are enjoying skateboarding and inline skating in the area. \nYoung students also visit often as there are many schools nearby, and families drop by to practice their curves. Moreover, the wide space can be utilized by beginners for their benefit. \n\nMyeongnyun Inline Skating Rink: 497-2, Oncheon-dong, Dongnae-gu, Busan\nWalk for 3 min from Exit 1 of Myeongnyun Station on Busan Metro Line 1\n\n\nAre you tired of the piling stress and dying passion as you age? Work out your body and regain your lost confidence! Come and skateboard!\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Night is a time of rest for travelers as they run out of energy from walking all day while enjoying things and tasting food. After a leisurely dinner and dessert, tourists don’t feel like doing anything. Anyone would also be exhausted by the end of the day with the currently hot weather.\n\nWhen you are in Busan, however, you have to enjoy nightlife. Unexpected fun is hidden all over Busan, and many travel destinations in the province are even more gorgeous at night. You’ll only experience half of Busan if you miss out on nightlife. As such, let’s travel to destinations that are completely different during the day and the night like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. \n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Orangdae</p>Located near the city, Orangdae is an unusual and famous site that represents Gijang, where the blue East Sea and unique rock formations create harmony to present a beautiful scenery. Yongwangdan Altar, a place where people wish fishermen good luck before heading out to the ocean, adds an exotic feel to the place.\n\n“Oran” from “orangdae” means “five men.” The name originated from five Confucian scholars who were exiled to Gijang and known for sitting above the cliff and appreciating the arts.\n\nThe travel to Orangdae begins at dawn. As it is surrounded by the ocean, Busan sees the sun rise from all angles. However, Orangdae is the place to be if we had to pick a single spot to enjoy the sunrise. Rough waves move about as if they would swallow the rocks at dawn, and Yongwangsan Altar, which faces the vast ocean, sheds a flickering light on the hazy ocean. Moreover, the horizon that appears from the darkness is flushed red. Soon, the round sun emerges from the ocean, lighting up a fire in one’s mind. It is a moving sight that you can only experience at Orangdae.\nA nice coastal trail is formed along Orangdae. Daebyeonhang Port is located on the left when you face the ocean, while Hilton Hotel is on the right. For a perfect half-day course, you may start at Hilton Hotel, pass by Orangdae, and go up to Daebyeonhang Port. Get away from the craziness of Haeundae or Gwangalli to enjoy the peaceful ocean near Gijang, and take a moment to reflect. \nAt night, Orangdae sets a romantic mood, thanks to the stars, which you rarely see in the city. The beach in Gijang makes for a great stargazing area as it doesn’t have much artificial lighting. The area surrounding Orangdae is also hidden by mountains, allowing visitors to have a clear view of the night sky. When you visit toward the end of the month when the moon is less visible, you will see a sky packed with stars that can be seen by the naked eyes. Listen to the splashing waves, watch the stars, and experience the true meaning of the word, “romance!” \n\nThere’s more! Little stars shine brightly along the horizon in the ocean, where darkness has settled in. They come from the lights of fishing boats to attract fish. Like the numerous stars in the night sky, these little lights also rise and set by the waters. Visit Orangdae to enjoy the ocean’s charms at night!\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Mipo, Haeundae</p>Everyone knows Haeundae, but most people don’t know Mipo. Some locals are also unfamiliar with the place as it is overshadowed by the magnificent Haeundae Beach. However, this place was where the protagonists of the movie, “Haeundae,” operated a shop.\n\nDongbaekseom Island is at the right end when facing Haeundae Beach, and Mipo sits at the left. As the leading hot spot of Busan, Dongbaekseom Island has a gorgeous natural landscape, skyscrapers, and a great night view. However, the other side is not as popular, and locals visit the area more than tourists. \n\n Walk toward the end of Songjeong to get to the fresh fish center and cruise dock, and stroll further along the ocean to reach a fishing village with a small port. This is Mipo, which surprises people at first because of its unfamiliar scene compared to Haeundae Beach.\nSmall fishing boats are lined up as if they were heading out to the ocean, and there is also an old supermarket that you would see in a TV drama. It is a place where locals live and breathe life, unlike a nicely decorated tourist town. When you lift your head, you will see 100-story skyscrapers looking down on the port. Moreover, this place seems uninterested in catching up with advancements although its surrounding area changes so quickly. This disconnect is what makes the place so attractive. \n\nWalk further along the alleyway from the port to reach a café at a dead end, which features Busan’s best night viewing spot. Enjoy a panoramic view of the city’s dramatic night sky along the coast, and appreciate the surrounding scenery from Haeundae Beach to Marine City, Dongbaekseom Island, Gwangandaegyo Bridge, and Igidae Cliff.\nIf you visit around late afternoon, you can also see the sunset behind Gwangandaegyo Bridge. Taste fresh seafood while sitting at an outdoor table against the backdrop of Busan’s nightscape, which is comparable to Hong Kong’s million-dollar view, to wrap up the day. What a satisfying trip!\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Hwangnyeongsan Beacon</p>Climb an observatory to see Busan at a glance. Many observatories are located in Busan’s numerous mountains, and Hwangnyeongsan Beacon is one of them. Located at the center, Hwangnyeongsan Mountain offers a full view of all regions in the province. Enjoy a 360° panoramic view of Haeundae, Yeongdo Island, Nampo-dong, Yeonsan-dong, Geumjeongsan Mountain, and Dongnae, where the city hall is, to the left, as well as Gwangalli in front.\n\nThere is a two-lane road going up the summit, so you don’t have to worry about hiking. Get off the parking lot, and climb the wooden deck for 10 minutes to reach the Beacon Observatory with an open view. Once there, you will see the symbolic Gwangandaegyo Bridge, Bukhangdaegyo Bridge, Yeongdo Island, Centum, and Haeundae at a glance. \nA well-organized walking path and exploration trail can be trudged upon along the beacon. If you like walking, you should follow the ridge up to Sajabong Peak, and look at places that you couldn’t see from the beacon. Walk along the road to Gwangalli, and climb up the observatory that is located in the middle to check out Busan’s view.\n\nVisit at dawn to see the sun rise toward Haeundae, and see the sun set in Songdo in the late afternoon. You will also see an impressive landscape no matter when you visit as the spot offers great views at both significant times of the day. \nHwangnyeongsan Beacon shines most brightly at night like a night-view gift package offered by Busan. All nightscape spots are visible from the area, and the scenery from the mountain at night is much more impressive than seeing it from the ground. The 2D space now becomes 3D, providing a much more vivid view especially for photographers who climb the mountain despite their heavy equipment. As such, Hwangnyeongsan Beacon is also the best place to watch the Busan International Fireworks Festival.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "The “lotus flower” has a nickname of “Hwajunggunja (花中君子),” which means “a gentleman among flowers” because of its dignified charm comparable to that of a virtuous man. The flower stands tall in green fields, revealing its charming flushed skin that would make you look back in appreciation. Let’s embark on a journey to see lotus flowers on hot summer days! It’d be great if the weather is good. If not, it’s fine too! Let’s head to Busan’s lotus flower destinations this summer.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Samnak Eco Park</p>Established along Nakdonggang River, Nakdonggang Eco Park is frequently visited by Busan residents. In particular, Samnak Eco Park, one of the parks in the area, is well-loved for its accessibility via subway and intracity buses. Many visitors flock to the park all year round as different flowers bloom each season, and water plants and migratory birds can be easily spotted.  \nThe lotus complex set on one side of the park creates a magnificent view of lotus flowers in July, when the summer begins. Red lotus, white lotus, and water lilies fill the water, making it the perfect spot to take great pictures. As such, the lotus complex is always packed with photographers from all over the country.\n\nTake a break at the pavilion built in the middle of the lotus complex when the summer heat becomes unbearable. Sit on the wooden floor to appreciate the flowers, and the cool river breeze will cool you down in no time. Visit around sunset to admire the beautiful sundown as well. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Dugu-dong Lotus Reservoir</p>A small lotus reservoir is located at Dugu-dong, the northern area of Busan. Although Dugu-dong is near the heart of the city, it is a quiet country village that makes you feel as if you were traveling back in time to a different place.\n\nWalk for about five minutes past the village entrance to quickly reach the lotus reservoir. The modest-sized pond is packed with lotus flowers, exuding green energy. As you stroll further, you will be captivated by pure white lotus flowers that peek coyly between green leaves. \nWalk toward the center of the lotus field to find the observation deck across the reservoir for easier and better viewing of lotus flowers. Look down over the flowers, and see their leaves and flowers appear more three dimensional.\n\nFrogs sit under the shades of large lotus leaves to cool down. As you watch them, you’ll hear frogs splashing into the water to escape the scorching heat.\n\nAlong the banks of the reservoir, the trail showcases all kinds of blooming summer flowers and adds a romantic summer touch. You can easily finish walking along the short path in 10 minutes, but enjoying the summer flowers and taking photos will take about an hour. Picture-perfect sculptures are also installed along the reservoir.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Daejeo Eco Park</p>Along with Samnak Eco Park, Daejeo Eco Park is also a part of Nakdonggang Eco Park. The vast space offers an unrealistic, beautiful view of mustard flowers in the spring, as well as sunflowers and cosmos in the summer. In the fall, romantic pink muhly grasses decorate the area, making the park a must-see destination in Busan.\n\nCurrently, sunflowers and cosmos have not yet bloomed in the park as it is still the peak season for lotus flowers. Unlike the small and cozy Samnak Eco Park or Dugu-dong Lotus Reservoir, Daejeo Eco Park has a large, open space with an endless lotus field.\nFrom the parking lot, walk for about 10 minutes toward the river to reach the lotus flower complex. The sight of lotus flowers filling up the vast field is surreal as thousands of recently bloomed red lotus flowers wave at you from different locations. You can only see them from outside, but the scale is overwhelming. The view is great on clear days, but it looks more magnificent during rainy days. When wet, lotus flowers and leaves appear fresher, and raindrops falling on the lotus field creates a romantic feel. \n\n\n"

It is the place that Emperor Lee Gon accidentally discovers the “door of dimensions”. Ahopsan Forest located in Gijang-gun, Busan where the forest has a long history of 400 years yet also serves as a significant location that explains the drama’s overall plot.\nThe most remarkable thing about this location is the towering bamboo trees that form a large forest. When you raise your head, you will notice that the bamboo leaves sway in the breeze like ocean waves. Standing in between the stone door among the bamboo trees with the sun sunlight peeking through the trees makes the atmosphere mysterious and beautiful as you like the hero/heroine of the drama that can travel to another world with the gate of time slip.\n\nAddress: 37-1, Midong-gil, Cheolma-myeon, Gijang-gun, Busan\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Haeundae Gunam-ro</p>The scene between Emperor Lee Gon and his rival Lee Lim was a highlighted part of the drama, and this scene was filmed at Gunam-ro, the main street of Haeundae. \nHaeundae Gunam-ro is the road that connects to Haeundae Beach, usually gathering crowds of people.

While admiring their glorious night views, you will also be able to enjoy their solitary ambiance. \n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Site of Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town</p>The Site of Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town shows that Dongnae was the center of Busan in the past. Traces of Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town remain in wide areas along the mountains and plains of Dongnae. The present Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town, which has been restored along the discovered walls, is a place of healing in the city that provides relaxation and rest to visitors. It is a great place for enjoying a stroll. You can walk along the walls that extend from the North Gate, or climb up the North Gate to look down on the peaceful downtown. When darkness falls on Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town, the lighting embraces the long fortress and presents a romantic ambiance.\nThe North Gate that appeared magnificent during the day claims extra subtle beauty at night alongside the delicate lighting. The sleek eaves spread out like the wings of a bird and the beautiful pattern reflected in the light provides a unique elegance. The night view of Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town shines brighter in the brilliant lighting and the fortress road of the Joseon Dynasty feels mysterious as it is reflected in the moonlight.\nWalk along the trail formed by the long and stretched-out wall for a romantic experience.

This park used to serve as a military hub. However, the fortress no longer exists, and there only remains some destruction of the military site, which includes the south gate and the arched stone wall that served as the main gate to the fortress.\nA stone wall path with roof tiles creates an antique atmosphere for visitors to experience. It’s a perfect place for a peaceful walk in autumn. A big black pine tree stands at the entrance of the south gate, and it’s assumed to have been there for over 400 years. This tree is also known as a sacred protector of the soldiers of the fortress. Another ancient muku tree stands in the park as well. The tree looks magnificently split into two parts from the root and is known to be 500 years old. The majesty of the two trees is rooted in its survival to witness hundreds of years of Korean history, which compels every visitor to pay their respects. \nThe park may be small, but it houses important pieces of history.

Come and enjoy the full package of autumn flower paths endlessly revealing along Nakdonggang River.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">1. Eulsukdo Eco Park</p>Opposite the Museum of Contemporary Art Busan, the Picnic field at Eulsukdo Eco Park becomes pink during the end of September, the climax of autumn. Pink muhly, called Muhlenbergia capillaries, is in full bloom, making you feel the atmosphere of autumn and fall. It is not very large, but it is a cluster that surrounds the corner of the park in a circular shape, so it is not enough to enjoy a light walk and feel the autumn feeling. (Unfortunately, the beautiful spot cannot be seen currently as the pink muhly grass was cut off because of COVID-19.)\nA wide grass field extends in the middle of the park’s Picnic field. Why not resting under the shade of a big tree and feel the gentle autumn breeze when you are tired from walking around the pink muhly grass field to take once-in-a-lifetime photos? Picnic field as from its name, you can know that many people are having a picnic on mats or reading books under the trees’ shades.\n\nEulsukdo Park shines the most when the sun goes down. The drowsy sunlight dyes the world golden and creates a scene in the movie. If you want to take great portraits, don't miss this moment. Life photography is born in this light.\n\nEulsukdo Eco Park\n1142, Hadan-dong, Saha-gu, Busan\nExit 3 of Hadan Station on Busan Metro Line 1 → Transfer to Bus 3, 55, 58, 58-2, 168, 520, 1005, 2000, 58-1, or 221 and get off at Eulsukdo (Cultural Center) and walk for 10 min\nParking: Eulsukdo Public Parking Lot\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">2. Samnak Eco Park</p>Located about 10 minutes away by car from Eulsukdo Eco Park, Samnak Eco Park is an urban park with varying landscapes per season every year. The season when you can fully feel the charm of Samrak Ecological Park is definitely autumn. This is because you can meet the endless scenery of pure white reed flowers. A feast of reed flowers can be seen throughout Samnak Eco Park from mid-September to the end of October. Reeds flowers grow densely along Nakdonggang River, making it difficult to know where the field ends. As the wind blows, the white reeds begin to sway together like waves. They seem to hang on each other's shoulders and wanted to dance group dances, and each waved their bodies in the wind, showing off their splendid figure. If you stand still and watch it, a smile pops up on your face.\nThe Wetland Park at Samnak Eco Park allows you to take a pleasant walk in the autumn wind. Along with the glory of lotus flowers blooming in summer, the reed flowers are also eye-catching. Do not miss either the wildflower garden or cosmos flower field, flush with various flowers. As you leisurely walk along the trail through trees while enjoying the diverse autumn scene, you will completely forget how time passes.\n\nSamnak Eco Park\n29-46, Samnak-dong, Sasang-gu, Busan\nGet off at Exit 1 of Gwaebeop Renecite Station on Busan-Gimhae Light Rail Transit and walk for 16 min.\nParking: Samnak Eco Park Public Parking Lot\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">3. Daejeo Eco Park</p>The pink muhly habitat at Daejeo Eco Park is much larger than that of Eulsukdo Eco Park. The wide space allows people to take pictures or enjoy sightseeing freely despite the crowds. Compared to Eulsukdo Eco Park and Samnak Eco Park, its landscape blends with the city’s scenery. Although it does not seem to be completely separated from the city center like Eulsukdo or Samrak Ecological Park, the coolness of the spacious space around the Nakdong River is the charm of Daejeo Ecological Park. Busan is a place where there are many mountains, does not have more flat land than expected. Most are slopes or hills, making it difficult to meet the horizon. However, in Daejeo Ecological Park, you can meet the horizon. Also, another advantage is Daejeo Ecological Park is close to Gangseo-gu Office Station on Subway Line 3, so you can always find it easily.\nA long trail runs along the riverbank. Trees line up nicely on both sides of the trail, with reed flowers sparsely peeking in between. A path through the bamboo grove also welcomes people. Although the landscape is not as overwhelming as Samnak Eco Park, it still gives off the perfect autumn feel. The travel experience reaches a climax when a plane from Gimhae International Airport flies against the sunset’s glow. If you have a camera, you should press the shutter to capture that specific moment.\n\nDaejeo Eco Park \n2314-11, Daejeo 1(il)-dong, Gangseo-gu, Busan\nExit 3 of Gangseo-gu Office Station on Busan Metro Line 3 → Transfer to Bus 125 at the Gangseo-gu Office Station Stop → Get off at Busan Hyewon School and walk for 8 min\nParking: Daejeo Eco Park Public Parking Lot\n\n\n"

Tie your shoelaces, and start hiking up the terrific trails for beginners. Why not refresh yourself as you walk on the hiking trail surrounded by the lush forest?\nIn Busan stands numerous mountains, and Baesan, which is surrounded by residential areas, can be seen as a rather high hill. It only takes an hour to completely walk along the Baesan Trail. The locals hike through the forest on a daily basis. Because of its low altitude, the mountain seems to have trails for everyone regardless of age and gender. If you want a section with a slope, you should take the route starting from Baesan Station of Busan Metro Line 3 to Yeonsan Reservoir. Meanwhile, if you want to start with a gentle slope, you can choose the route starting from the Ancient Tombs in Yeonsan-dong. Besides these two routes, the trail around Baesan Mountain is very diverse. In fact, you can even start hiking from anywhere!\nLet’s go to the Ancient Tombs in Yeonsan-dong with light steps. Nothing is better than a leisurely stroll as you enjoy the refreshing smell of grass in the dense green forest. As you walk on your own path, you will see the ancient tombs. It’s lined with 18 graves  of the ruling class from the period of the Three Kingdoms. The size is bigger than expected, so exploring it will be a great way to warm up before hiking.\nBaesan Forest Trail begins right across the entrance of the Ancient Tombs in Yeonsan-dong. Climb a little up the stairway and walk on the flat trail. This mountain is low, but its forest is as thick as that of any other mountain. Enjoy the sunlight streaming through the trees, the fresh air, and the gentle breeze. Why not discover the beauty of hiking along Baesan Forest Trail amid the mysterious vitality of nature all over the trail?\nVarious exercise equipment and rest areas where you can sit and relax are provided along the trail. You don’t need separate food to keep your energy up because there are no difficult sections, but it would be nice to take a break and enjoy a cup of hot coffee. After completing the hike, why not head towards the summit of the mountain while checking the mileposts? Don’t miss the chance to snap a photo of yourself next to the peak stone.

Visit the colorful and picturesque landscape!\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Jangnim Port</p>Jangnim Port is a popular destination among a lot of young people and photographers because of its exotic landscape. They feel like they are in the water city, Venice. That is why it is referred to as “Bunezia,” or “Busan’s Venezia (Venice).”\nLocated in Saha-gu, Busan, Jangnim Port was once well-known for the production of salt, laver, and marsh clams. At present, it is a peaceful port where small boats are anchored, and it is also operated as a cultural complex after maintenance work around the areas. A row of small rainbow-colored buildings is a landmark here. These colorful pretty buildings are actually used as warehouses where fishermen keep their fishing gear. You can take unique pictures and play with different color sensitivity against the backdrop of each colorful structure.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Huinnyeoul Culture Village</p>Huinnyeoul Culture Village, also called the “Santorini of Korea,” is aligned with a coastal cliff, thus boasting of a fantastic view in harmony with the ocean. This used to be a shelter for refugees who had to leave their homes during the Korean War, but now, it is an art and cultural village that people want to visit.\nThe white and blue colors represent Huinnyeoul Culture Village. The Jeoryeong Coastal Trail features the contrast between the sky-blue tiled floor and the long white wall surrounding the village. In addition to white and blue colors, other colors also comprise Huinnyeoul Culture Village. The beautiful colors permeate the stairs connecting the village and the coastal walkway, showing the characteristics of each stairway. Colorful neon signs also await travelers even in the Huinnyeoul Coastal Tunnel. Why not explore the romantic village while listening to the refreshing sound of the waves?\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Gamcheon Culture Village</p>Gamcheon Culture Village, also known as the “Machu Picchu of Korea,” features a unique landscape: tiers of houses clinging to the slopes and alleyways tangled like a maze. Moreover, this village used to be a place where refugees resided after the Korean War. At present, it is a venue where history, culture, and art coexist in harmony.\nUpon entering Gamcheon Culture Village, you’ll feel like you are in a colorful fairy tale. You won’t help but be fascinated with the colorful sculptures and murals with brilliant concepts throughout the village.\nThe tiers of houses on the hillsides boast of a variety of colors, stretching out like a picture. The Little Prince statue perched high quietly protects the villagers who have unshakably endured tough lives after surviving a trial by war.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Choryang Ibagu-gil Road</p>The Choryang Ibagu-gil Road has 168 Stairs, whose height is equivalent to a six-story building. It is a widely well-known filming location used for many Korean entertainment programs. You can listen to the intact stories of modern and contemporary Korean history along the stairway.\nIt used to be a steep hillside but was transformed into 168 Stairs after the development project. At present, a monorail is in operation aligned with the stairway for the convenience of the residents and visitors. The cute red monorail mingling with the rainbow-colored wall before the platform attracts the public gaze. While climbing up the hill on the monorail, you can enjoy a panoramic view of the city.\nEach step of 168 Stairs is decorated with colorful mosaic tile paintings. The different rainbow colors on every staircase and wall fill the hearts of travelers with romantic sentiments.\n\nCome and enjoy the rainbow colors of Busan!\n\n\n"

Located at the eastern end of Haeundae, Mipo is also the site of Haeundae Beach Train’s Mipo Station. This beautiful port boasts a great view of the contrast between the skyscrapers of Haeundae on one side and the lights from the small fishing boats lining the coast on the other. Take slow steps to the Mipo Blueline Park square. “Blue Line” is the official name of Haeundae Beach Train. From Mipo Port to Songjeong, the entire trail is decked out in wooden platforms. Some staircases lead you around the coastal cliffs to an amazing view of the sea. Seeing Haeundae from Daritdol Observatory gives a whole new vibe to the district’s skyscrapers. Dalmaji Tunnel, once painted with a whitish gray, now features different colors. Make sure to take some pictures for your albums here!\nThese signposts lead you through Busan Green Railway while letting you know your current location on the trail and the remaining distance to the next section. An old-fashioned beach train runs by the trail at a leisurely pace, bringing the mountains and the seas together to create unique scenery. Cheongsapo Port’s view is completed by the sharp contrast of red and white from the Twin Lighthouses, the blue sea, and the sky. If you’re feeling brave, walk on the transparent Daritdol Observatory, and watch the waves striking the rocks far below.\nThe second half of the walking trail is made up of the Gudeokpo–Songjeong section. If you’re walking all the way from Mipo Port, you might have to rest your legs a bit. Don’t worry! There are plenty of spots for you to take a breather and enjoy the sight of the sea all the way to the horizon. Slightly further is Jukdo Park at the end of Songjeong Beach, which would be a great place to wrap up this walk. If you’re lucky enough to arrive during sunset hours, you can enjoy an unparalleled view of the sunset descending into the sea. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size20 colorDarkBlue bold\">Haeundae Beach Train Line: Mipo Station – Dalmaji Tunnel – Cheongsapo Station – Cheongsapo Daritdol Observatory – Gudeokpo Port – Songjeong Station</p>\nHaeundae Beach Train travels the Mipo–Songjeong section of Busan Green Railway, offering a great view of East Busan’s beautiful scenery. The train itself runs parallel to the walking trail, along the breathtaking and rapidly changing scenery of the coast. In-person ticket booths are only available at the three main stations of Mipo, Cheongsapo, and Songjeong, but tickets can also be purchased at automated ticketing machines located on other stops as well. A ride on Haeundae Beach Train gives you a different view and feeling from the one to be had on foot.\nYou will be treated to the expansive view of the sea on Haeundae Beach Train. Its retro-style exterior and tasteful use of colors add a splash of uniqueness to Haeundae’s scenery. All seats on the train are turned toward the beach, so everyone has a panoramic view of East Busan’s sea. Sunshine scattering onto the waves brings about deep feelings of rest and peace. Sky Capsule, which runs on an elevated railway, is slated to be opened in December. This four-person Sky Capsule connects Mipo and Songjeong Stations without any stops in between. Just like the beach train, it is expected to be a highly popular addition to Haeundae’s tourism scene. We invite you to go on a romantic ride on Haeundae Beach Train!\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "** This content was filmed in compliance with COVID-19 quarantine guidelines.\n\nAlso called the “rice thief” by some, salted pollack roe (myeongnanjeot) has a loyal following because of its savory and salty flavor that pairs perfectly with rice. However, did you know that Busan’s Dong-gu is the origin of this dish? In the 1900s, Choryang was the site of Busan’s first industrial warehouse, where all pollack caught in Korean waters were processed. People began to experiment with the nutritious roe of pollack, resulting in the famous salted pollack roe. Trace the origins of salted pollack roe in Choryang Myeongnan Road!\n\n<div class=\"type1\"><div class=\"headWrap\"><p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Choryang Myeongnan Road</p></div><ul class=\"course1\"><li><span>Namseon Warehouse Site</span></li><li><span>Choryang Ibagu-gil Mural Alley </span></li><li><span>168 Stairs </span></li><li><span>Ibagu Chungjeonso Myeongnan Self-Cooking Class</span></li></ul></div>\nBuilt in the 1900s, Namseon Warehouse served as an industrial seafood storage building and housed the largest supply of pollack in southern Korea at that time. It consisted of five buildings, with a system of artificial waterways built in to ensure a consistent temperature in the warehouse. At that time, pollack roe was an overflowing side product of the pollack trade, and the people of Busan naturally developed ways to process and eat them. During the period of Japanese Occupation, a Japanese living in Choryang imported the salted pollack roe tradition to Japan, which formed the origins of Japan’s mentaiko tradition. Unfortunately, Namseon Warehouse was demolished completely in 2009, and only a red wall stands as a reminder of its place in Busan’s modern history.\nFrom the former site of Namseon Warehouse, the famous Choryang Ibagu-gil Road branches out. Choryang Ibagu-gil Road’s Mural Alley is an outdoor gallery where Choryang’s modern history is inscribed along the winding alleyways of the neighborhood. As you travel back in time to Choryang’s history while you walk along the walls, you will eventually arrive at the 168 Stairs. This steep staircase was the only path connecting the informal settlements built along the slope of the mountain to the rest of the city. Today, a red monorail system runs along the 168 Stairs, a stark reminder of how Busan has developed over the years.\nAt the end of the 168 Stairs is Ibagu Chungjeonso, the perfect place to experience the taste of Choryang’s salted pollack roe. The Myeongnan Self-Cooking Class is held here, and the star of the class is the salted pollack roe pasta. All ingredients and utensils are available on site, so all you have to do is follow the lecturer’s instructions. Information on Choryang Myeongnan Road tours can be found in the Busan Bus Tour website. \nSalted pollack roe pasta is actually easy to make! Boil the pasta noodles, and drain out the water. In a pan, fry onions, garlic, and other aromatics in olive oil until the kitchen is filled with tantalizing fragrances. Afterward, throw in the pasta noodles and salted pollack roe, and stir-fry the mixture for a bit to bring the flavors together.\nYou can also grab a bite of salted pollack roe on the second floor of the Ibagu Chungjeonso building. On the second floor, a unique and comfortable design is brought about by the old houses of Busan. It is partitioned to respect the privacy of the guests as well. Put some pasta on your plate, and enjoy the texture and the freshness of pollack roe.\nFrom the origins of salted pollack roe in the Namseon Warehouse site to the self-cooking class at the end of the Choryang Myeongnan Road, choose this course if you’re looking for an interesting experience in Busan. You can even treat yourself to a view of Busan’s mountainside road from the top of the stairs!\n\n\n\n"

To Yongdusan Park, of course!”\nThe year 2020 has been rather difficult for everyone, and we hope that we’ll be able to return to a sense of normalcy as the new year approaches. During these weary days, Yongdusan Park’s Moon Rabbit nighttime photo zone offers a small solace. \nThe famous Yongdusan Park takes on a completely different charm when it shines with beautiful lights to offer a romantic sanctuary for those who wander around at night. Busan Tower’s media facade offers a constantly shifting scene, while special lighting projects offer a warm comfort in the coldest winter nights. The beautiful views of Busan’s city center at night are a quintessential part of Yongdusan Park’s charms and a glimpse of happiness we discover anew amid the far-reaching changes in our daily lives.\n\n\n\nOh? Is that the moon and a rabbit I see?\nThe plaza in front of Busan Tower is now home to the mythical Moon Rabbit surrounded by beautiful lights. Korea shares the folklore of the Moon Rabbit with many East Asian cultures. In the tale, the moon shows the figure of a rabbit working tirelessly on a mortar, but these days, the rabbit’s apparently enjoying a vacation at Yongdusan Park. This nighttime photo zone is actually a public exhibition held to serve as solace to the people of Busan. We’re no strangers to the new phenomenon of the “Corona Blues,” so we hope that the Moon Rabbit photo zone can offer some comfort in these trying times.\n\n\n\nVisitors’ faces light up with surprise and curiosity at seeing the massive rabbit in Yongdusan Park. “What’s this?” someone murmurs as other people fiddle with the switch and step closer to say hi to the rabbit. They say, “I’ve got to take a picture of this,” and shutters begin to click. As visitors indulge in selfies, the park is once again filled with laughter. If we could make a wish to the moon, we would wish that a future as bright as the Moon Rabbit will arrive soon. \n\n\n\nEven though we’ve been through hardships together as the year brought our lives to a standstill, we hope that the time we spend with the Moon Rabbit will offer us a small gift of solace.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Busan is a city of many mountains. Spanning over Dongnae-gu, Geumgjeong-gu, and Buk-gu, Geumjeongsan Mountain is the tallest among the mountains in Busan. From Godangbong Peak rising some 800m above sea level, ridges extend down to the center of Busan, forming the city’s base. Embracing Beomeosa Temple, an ancient Buddhist temple from Silla, within, Geumjeongsan Mountain is surrounded by Geumjeongsanseong Fortress with four gates. \n\nMandeok Pass is an old road located to the south of Geumjeongsan Mountain. This was the only road connecting Dongnae and Gupo prior to the opening of Mandeok Tunnel. There must have been a band of thieves on this mountain road as the road was used by peddlers carrying bags of goods to sell at Dongnae Market and Gupo Market. According to a legend, the road was called “Manneunggogae,” meaning that you must cross over the pass in a group of ten thousand in order to avoid the thieves. Locals say that the current name of this road, “Mandeokgogae (Mandeok Pass),” originated from “Manneunggogae.”\n\nWith two tunnels and even a subway line opened under this trail, there is no longer any need to climb over Mandeok Pass. Nevertheless, Mandeok Pass Trail is coming back to life thanks to the magnificent nightscape spreading at its foot and the surprising treasures hidden throughout.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">1. Mandeok Pass Trail</p>The starting point of Mandeok Pass Trail begins to the right of the bus stop at the entrance to Mandeok Tunnel 1. After a short walk up along a wooden deck, a dense forest spreads right before me. The green foliage that surrounds me instantly refreshes my eyes. The scent of grass wafts into my nose and the gentle breeze of the forest tickles my ears. Everything around me is so completely new that I have forgotten all about the urban landscape I was in only several minutes ago.\n\nThe trail is not too steep. Strolling along, feeling the energy of Geumjeongsan Mountain with my entire body, I soon arrive at an underpass, which is a boundary point between Dongnae-gu and Buk-gu. From here, the trail continuously descends. The distance from the bus stop at the entrance to Mandeok Tunnel to Buk-gu Recycling Center is approx. 4.5 kilometers. Even at a leisurely pace, it’s only a two-hour walk.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">2. Café Mandeokgogae-gil 436</p>Walking for a short while along Mandeok Pass Trail from the entrance to Mandeok Tunnel 1, I run into a café hidden in the forest. The address, “Mandeokgogae-gil 436,” happens to be the name of this café. Designed under the concept of rabbits on the moon, which, according to the legend, used to dwell on Mandeok Pass Trail, the most noticeable feature of this café is the garden. Nestled in the dense forest with tables and chairs sparsely placed, it makes me feel as though I am camping in the forest. The charm of Mandeokgogae-gil 436 is that it embraces and harmonizes with nature.\n\nAt night when lights are turned on, the café transforms into a romantic space. As I enjoy a cup of fragrant coffee while listening to the sounds of insects, the fatigue of the day washes away. This café is worth a visit even just to experience a nature-friendly café in the heart of the city.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">3. Geumgangdae Okbulsa Temple</p>Continuing on the trail for approx. 1km from Mandeokgogae-gil 436, I arrive at Geumgangdae Okbulsa Temple. The unpaved forest trail, which starts at the entrance to the temple site, soon changes into a steep slope. Geumgangdae Okbulsa Temple is situated at the end of the slope.\n\nThe stairs extending from the slope guarded by Twelve Zodiac Animal Deities lead to the temple grounds. With precipitous cliffs and magnificent rocks surrounding the temple buildings, what immediately draws my attention is the statue of Buddha engraved on a gigantic rock. This 6m relief stone statue of Buddha with eleven faces is the Rock-carved Eleven-faced Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva of Geumgangdae. \n\nStanding in front of the statue, I not only see Dongnae right below my feet, but see Jangsan Mountain in the far distance. It is quite interesting to observe the buildings on the temple grounds as these differ from those of ordinary Buddhist temples. This is not a crowded temple, which makes it an ideal space for relaxing and enjoying a moment of tranquility.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">4. Rest Area</p>Mandeok Pass Trail meanders on, maintaining a gentle slope. The walk is not too strenuous as the slope is gradual enough even for children. If you are not familiar with trekking, you can take a moment to catch your breath at the rest area located along the trail.\n\nFrom the rest area, I catch a glimpse of the cityscape in between the trees. I am only a few hundreds of meters from the main road, but it feels as though I am standing at a faraway distance. With few cars passing by now and then, it is quite an alluring feeling to have this tranquil forest trail entirely to myself.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">5. Mandeok Pass Trail Observation Deck</p>Passing through the rest area after Okbulsa Temple, I am getting close to the end of my trip. Mandeok Pass Trail Observation Deck, the terminal point of the trail and my destination, is just around the corner. I am walking on a trail deep in the forest one minute and entering a wide open space the next. Then, the hidden cityscape unfolds before me like a scene from a movie.\n\nI cannot just pass by this magnificent point. An observation deck was built to help visitors like myself enjoy the scenery comfortably. The observation deck stands dizzily on top of a steep cliff, as if floating up in the air. Under the observation deck below the mountain, spreads the landscape of Busan. I see Centum City in the distance and the blue waves of the sea in the backdrop. To the left lies Dongnae-gu and to the right Yeonje-gu and Busanjin-gu. I can also see Jangsan, Baesan, and Hwangnyeongsan Mountains afar. The one-hour walk along the trail was certainly worthwhile.\n\n\n\nThe sun is about to set. I am just in time for the gentle rays of the sun transforming the city into a golden yellow. I could not otherwise enjoy this beautiful scenery when moving briskly about in the city like a part of a machine. \n\nAs the sun slowly sets, everyone from couples holding hands and families with children to photographers holding cameras flock around the deck. Now that the sun has set, I wait for the lights to turn on in the city. There are many great observatories in Busan, a city of mountains. Mandeok Pass Trail Observation Deck is one of them located only an hour’s walk away from the starting point of the trail . It is also a short ten-minute drive, which is why this observatory is popular these days as a destination for people out for a drive.\n\nDarkness falls in the city and the buildings light up one by one. The gray city takes on a tinge of blue momentarily. Then, the red lights from cars filling up the roads infuse life into the pale city. The gentle breeze brings with it the scent of the sea. The crescent moon over my head brightens up the observatory. What more could I want? \n\nMandeok Pass Trail becomes very dark at night. There are no streetlights. So, a flashlight is a must. I recommend taking this trail with friends or family rather than alone just in case of an unforeseen accident.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Busan is a city of beaches. Beaches are everywhere and certainly not a special feature of this city. But, there are beaches that are not widely known. These are the pebble beaches. \n\nWhen it comes to Busan, the first thing that comes to your mind would be beaches like Haeundae and Gwanganni. You may not realize that Busan also has a number of beaches with black pebbles instead of white sand. Keep your eye out for these beaches that are as beautiful as the famous black pebble beaches in Yeosu and on Geojedo Island. You will be able to find a unique charm of the beaches in Busan. \n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Igidae Pebble Beach</p>Igidae is a rocky cliff at the foot of Jangsanbong Peak that stands up against the East Sea. This was a former military operation zone, so public access had been restricted until being open to the public in 1993. Now, everyone can enjoy the breathtaking scenery of Igidae. \n\nWhile the 4.7km trekking course extending along the coastal cliff is magnificent, the view of Marine City high-rises in Haeundae over the sea makes Igidae all the more special. Strolling along the walking trail set against the backdrop of undulating waves, you will find yourself surprisingly calmed and refreshed. \n\nOn Igidae, the essence of the sea of Busan, you will find a hidden pebble beach. It is not far off from Dongsaengmal, the terminal point of Igidae coastal trail. This pebble beach is located coyly in front of a sea cave. Nestled between large rocks, the round black pebbles roll about in the waves, creating an interesting sight. When the waves rush in wildly, the sound of the rolling pebbles turns to sweet music.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Cheongsapo Pebble Beach</p>Located under a steep mountain slope between Haeundae and Songjeong, Cheongsapo is filled with the romantic vibes of a fishing village that cannot be found in large cities. Here, you can see many fishing boats anchored at the small port, various fishing gear dizzily scattered about, and fishermen briskly moving to and fro. Right in front of your eyes unfolds a scene you would expect to find after traveling for miles on the sea in a boat. \n\nFrequented by visitors vying to take photos in front of the beautiful lighthouse, Cheongsapo has recently become a national attraction after the opening of the coastal train service and Sky Capsule. A walking trail was also established along the coastline. As a result, the pebble beach, which was hidden from our eyes, has revealed itself. \n\nHidden under the coastal cliff, Cheongsapo Pebble Beach is also unfamiliar to the citizens of Busan. It had been completely inaccessible due to the rough terrain and because the area was used as a military base. Now, everyone can enter the Pebble Beach through a wooden deck. \n\nAs I walk through the dense forest, I already hear the sound of waves, which resembles the sound of heavy breathing. The sound of breaking waves blends with the rhythmic sound of black pebbles rolling about. After climbing down relatively steep stairs, I get to walk on the pebble beach with my feet. It is fun to watch the pebbles that vary in colors and sizes from those as big as a watermelon to bead-sized ones. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Taejongdae Pebble Beach</p>Offering a breathtaking view of the sea against precipitous cliffs and rocks, Taejongdae has always been one of the most famous tourist attractions of Busan. The sedimentary stratum from the latter phase of the Cretaceous period was eroded by waves as the sea level rose, forming a coastal beach with a wave-cut terrace, sea cliff, and sea cave. Taejongdae was designated as a UNESCO Global Geopark. \n\nTaejongdae has three pebble beaches and all of them are called “Jagalmadang (means ‘pebble yard’)” in Korean. Gamji Pebble Beach and Taewon Pebble Beach are located close to the main gate and Deungdae Pebble Beach is located near Yeongdo Lighthouse. In terms of the view, Deungdae Pebble Beach situated in between rocky cliffs tops the others.\n\nWalking down the stairs from Yeongdo Lighthouse Marine Culture Space to the sea, you will find a near-vertical coastal cliff on your right. Gigantic and rugged rocks soar up from and tower over the sea. The spaces between rocky cliffs through which waves undulate violently are filled with round pebbles. This is Deungdae Pebble Beach. The strong waves under the sea cliffs swept away light sand, leaving only the heavy pebbles to form this pebble beach. \n\nWhile the view from a high point is splendid, it is also great to take in the landscape on the pebble beach. After walking carefully along the coastline, I arrive at the pebble beach. The sea water is so crystal clear that I can see the bottom of the sea filled with pebbles. Over the pebble beach spreads the boundless open sea. The sea that has always been there since the ancient times.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Morundae Pebble Beach</p>There is a small hill protruding out towards the sea at the left end of Dadaepo Beach. This is Morundae. This island is often foggy and cloudy due to the sea currents, which make the island nearly invisible. Hence the name Morundae, meaning an island sinking under the cloud. \n\nClimbing up a steep slope at the entrance to Molundae for a little while, I arrive upon a dense forest. After walking for about ten minutes on a flat path, I see Dadaepo Guest House. To the left, the path leads to the beach. \n\nThe beach on the left of the path is a sandy beach and the one on the right is a pebble beach. Unlike the sandy beach that extends for quite a bit along the coastline, the pebble beach seems to be caught in between rocks. Although not very wide, the beach is full of flat and round pebbles. \n\nThe descending stairs lead me to the pebble beach. Standing on the beach, it seems to be bigger than looking down from the top of the hill. The waves rolling in violently from the sea soon disappear in between the pebbles. Under the sunlight, the black pebbles glitter like gemstones. Right next to the pebble beach, a small island floats on the sea. The lighthouse set on the island creates a romantic atmosphere. This is a new seascape I have never experienced in Busan. \n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "You will know the coming of the fall season when the wind is cool, the sky is high and maple leaves begin to transform into beautiful colors for you to enjoy pleasant strolls. On a day like this, you cannot help but want to break away from the hectic everyday life. Escape the noise and crowds and take a stroll on a healing trail in the city center where you can feel the colors of the fall in a quiet, relaxing manner.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Bongnaesan Deck Road, the most Busan-like scenery</p>Standing tall in the center of Yeongdo, Bongnaesan Mountain is the best place to welcome the pleasant fall season. There are different ways to climb the mountain but, typically, hikers depart from Jonaegi Sweet Potato History Park. The path leading up from the park to the mountain peak is thickly wooded with trees cast over your heads. Let’s begin our hike in this phytoncide-filled cypress forest while breathing in the clean, fresh air.\nHow awesome would it be to be able to view a thickly wooded forest and an indigo-blue sea together in a city? As you walk along the zigzag deck road that runs by the thickly wooded forest as it seemingly touches the sky, the wide open sea and the view of downtown Busan unfold before you like a scene from a painting. The deep colors of the fall and the cool, refreshing sea form the “most Busan-like scenery”!\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Dalmaji Black Pine Habitat, a unique side of Busan</p>How about taking a light stroll along a green forest road from which you can view the sea on a day with a cool autumn breeze? The name sounds somewhat unfamiliar but make sure to stop by the Black Pine Habitat located on Dalmaji Pass. Though it only takes about 10 minutes of walking for you to explore the entire area, a pleasant vibe engulfs you up as soon as you come face to face with the variety of flowers and the black pine colony. There are many themed ecology sections including the eco experience center, rest area, boardwalk and eco trail.\nAs you walk slowly on the W-shaped zigzag path, you will reach the end of the road before you realize. The sadness is momentary, however; your eyes will be pleased by the cute, colorful Sky Capsules passing by on the rails with the shining blue sea in the backdrop. How exciting it is to see a train running over the blue sea! It is the moment when you encounter a new aspect of the familiar Busan.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">800-year-old crape myrtle, Hwaji Park</p>There is a place in the middle of a gray, crowded city that features green trees and grass - Jeongmyosa Hwaji Park. Once you pass through the enormous Hyeongyeongmun Gate by the entrance, an unusual landscape appears as if the scene of a film unfolds. A small path that seems to be from a fairy tale runs between long lines of juniper trees and it feels as if a deer may pop out at any moment. The pebbles you step on make pleasant sounds.\nAt the end of this small path stands a crape myrtle that has remained in the same place on an open hill for over 800 years. Designated as a natural monument for being the oldest crape myrtle in Korea, it is the pride of Hwaji Park. In the scorching-hot summer, the crape myrtle blooms dark pink flower buds to show off its voluptuous appearance. Although the splendor of summer is gone by autumn when all the flowers fall off, you will be able to appreciate the ripening season.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "There is something that gives us comfort everyday with an appearance that seems both the same and different at the same time. This something is the “sky”! Whenever our hearts are stifled, a simple look towards the open, shining sky provides us with more heartwarming consolation than any words. But the sky is never the same. The beauty and the color of the sky changes depending on the harmonization of the landscape. The scenery of the western sky of Busan that features Songdo, Yeongdo and Busanhang Port displays an exotic but fantastic view including the gorgeous indigo-colored sea and the glamorous downtown. On an autumn day with “a high sky and plump horses”, let’s pay a visit to the observatories where we can fully appreciate the western sky of Busan.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Cheonmasan Observatory (Cheonmasan Sculpture Garden)</p>The forest path where the refreshing scent of grass, which we probably have only brushed past in the city, lingers at the tip of our nose leads to Cheonmasan Observatory. As you walk along a not-so-difficult flat trail, you will soon reach the observatory from which you will enjoy a panoramic view of the original city center and of the sky over Busanhang Port and Yeongdo Bridge. The tightly packed buildings form harmony with the sea and the mountain and do not look stuffy at all; instead, they look as dazzling as the night.\nWhen you turn your attention to Songdo and Namhangdaegyo Bridge, your heart cannot help but marvel at the vast sea, which is as exotic and beautiful as Hong Kong’s Victoria Peak. Cheonmasan Mountain is widely known as a popular green photo destination. If you wish to view the beautiful sky in harmony with nature and the city, make your way to Cheonmasan Observatory. You can get to the observatory from any of the following departure points - Chojang-dong, Amnam-dong, Nambumin-dong or Gamcheon-dong.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Amisan Observatory</p> Located on a hill, Amisan Observatory is a great place to view the romantic setting sun in the evening sky. If luck plays out with the weather, you may witness brilliant beams of light radiating through the clouds. The scenery of the observatory colors the sky, the sea and, even, the land in profound shades. I cannot think of a better place to visit when wishing to escape from your daily lives. You may find inner peace by watching the setting sun here.\nIf you feel a bit chilly by the evening wind, make your way to the 3rd floor indoor observation deck of Amisan Observatory. You will find it difficult to stop admiring the panoramic horizon. The highlight of the observatory is viewing the orange waves gently and gradually spreading with no lighting needed. As you sit in a small cafe sipping on tasty coffee with the sunset in your eyes, you will find yourself murmuring, “This is as good as it gets”. It would also be a good idea to see the sunset with your sight towards Dadaepo where a long deck path is seen in one view.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Yeongju Sky Eye Observatory </p> If you want a graceful nightscape, visit Yeongju Sky Eye Observatory, a place known for its spectacular night view and where endless lights of the city and stars in the sky chatter. If the word, “ecstasy,” can be expressed in something we can visually see, it would be the night sky viewed from Yeongju Sky Eye Observatory. Each of the houses lined up in a certain order exudes its simple and quiet elegance to add to the beauty. Another interesting element to check out is “Sky Eye Overlooking Busan,” a sculpture that expresses the characteristics of Busan, a city of harmony among the sea, mountains and city, into sculpted tiles.\nTurn your head towards the direction of Busanhang Port. The captivating night sky where dynamic lights come and go will make your eyes refreshed and offer you quiet and peaceful solitude in the midst of noisy and busy life. There is a bus stop directly in front of Yeongju Sky Eye Observatory so it can be conveniently visited and is not too far from our daily lives.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Untact tourism in nature is more popular than ever amid the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. The good news is, there’s a perfect place to enjoy a drive with your lover, your family, or even by yourself: the forest road that connects Sanseong Village, which is located beyond the East Gate from the entrance to the Geumjeongsanseong Fortress at Sanseong-ro, and the Hwamyeong Arboretum via the Geumjeongsanseong Multipurpose Plaza. A drive along this forest trail is like taking a shower in the refreshing phytoncide of the forest, which washes away all the fatigue and weariness you may have from your daily life. Let’s take a look at how to enjoy a healing forest drive in this picturesque scenery of verdant pine trees, framed by the open skies of fall. \n\n\n\n<div class=\"type1\"><div class=\"headWrap\"><p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Sanseong Village</p>In the forest of Geumjeongsan Mountain / amid the whisper of pine-scented breeze / I nurture the words of human / prepared just for you. / A faraway idea like the fall skies / taking the first blue step...\n\nThis is an excerpt from the poem “Reasons for Loving Geumjeongsan,” written by poet Kim Yeong-jun, which immortalizes the beauty of Geumjeongsan Mountain in fall. Geumseong-dong’s Sanseong Village, standing like a screen along the ridge of Geumjeongsan Mountain, has the same beauty exemplified by the fresh air and clear water. More than 90% of the land area here is occupied by greenery, which makes it a perfect place for a drive for those seeking inner peace. </div></div>\nOn weekends, the trail sees not only cars but also hikers who seek to enjoy the view of the fall colors on foot: it is easy to see why when one listens to the sounds of the fall breeze passing through the area, the wind sweeps the clutter from one’s mind and fills it with the ephemeral beauty of the season.\n\n\n\n<div class=\"type1\"><div class=\"headWrap\"><p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Geumjeongsanseong Multipurpose Plaza</p>For visitors out for a drive or a hike, Geumjeongsanseong Multipurpose Plaza is a great place to take a breather: but for Geumjeongsanseong Fortress, the Multipurpose Plaza is a place that hosts numerous cultural events, such as the Geumjeongsanseong Festival Drone enthusiasts find this area to be a perfect place for test flights, thanks to the expansive field, while the green grass makes the Plaza a great place for children to play in. The characters “Geumjeongsanseong” spelled out in Korean at the entrance to the plaza is a great place to take a picture. </div></div>\nIf these activities do not interest you, you will certainly find the green view of Geumjeongsan Mountain and the phytoncide-rich air to be perfect accompaniments to a peaceful stroll. Even better, try out a picnic! Take your favorite map out, and enjoy a nap before the day gets too cold. After that, you can take your pick among the cutesy cafes in the area, or restaurants specializing in duck dishes. \n\n\n\n<div class=\"type1\"><div class=\"headWrap\"><p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Hwamyeong Arboretum</p>The final stop in the forest drive is the Hwamyeong Arboretum. Situated between the clear waters of Daecheoncheon Stream and the Godangbong Peak to the rear, Hwamyeong Arboretum was opened in 2011 as the first public arboretum in the Busan area. With nearly 1,300 species of plants living in the forest habitat and the greenhouse, it is a popular date course for families, friends, and lovers. After all, what is healing but a close embrace with life that courses through nature? \nIt is also home to a forest library, from which you can rent out books and read them on outdoor benches or pavilion buildings. Didn’t somebody say that fall is a season for reading? Take a book for your soul and rediscover your inner peace in the fall colors of the forest. The phytoncide-rich trail between Geumjeongsanseong Fortress and the Hwamyeong Arboretum can also be accessed through Bus 203.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Busan! It is truly a city of a thousand sights. One finds oneself trying to fit more and more places to visit on one’s itinerary. Right when you exit Busan Station, cross the road to find “Jangseonghyang,” a Korean-Chinese restaurant featured in “Oldboy,” or “Hwaguk Banjeom,” featured in “Nameless Gangster: Rules of Time and New World.” Once you are full, head to Sanbok Road, a road that exemplifies the history of Busan, to start your journey in Busan. Take care, however, as your plans may unravel in the view of the city and the charming alleyways that bear the scent of the sea.\nSanbok Road is the best place to get a sense of Busan’s history. The houses cluttering on the slope feel like an art installation, created through the weary and poor lives of the war refugees and the dock workers later on. The road was created in the mid-1960s through the shantytown that occupied the slopes, thus allowing buses to ferry the residents to schools, workplaces, and their lives along the steep, snaking road. Over time, proper houses replaced the ramshackle buildings, and so did the neighborhood begin to change. The “Historical Diorama,” located at the midpoint of the slope toward Democracy Park, is an artistic representation of the area’s history. It is home to four structures, each exemplifying the themes of “jomang” (gazing into the distance), “namgo” (tracing the history), “eungsi” (gaze), and “jeonmang” (prospect). These themes speak to Busan’s nature, culture, modern history, and future, and the will contained within is completed with the view of the blue sea beyond. When one follows the road from the Historical Diorama upward, one arrives at Minju Park. This sculpture park, located at the summit of the mountain, is a popular hangout for locals. One sees games like baduk (go) and janggi (Korean chess) being played.\nPast this battle of wits and outside the exit to the side of the sculpture park is the book cafe “Mildawon Sidae.” “Mildawon Sidae” is a novel written by Kim Dong-ri in 1955 on a fictionalized account of the eponymous cafe, which became a hangout for displaced artists fleeing the Korean War. This cafe, inspired by the novel in turn, has recently become famous as having one of the best views in all of Busan. Take a seat by the glass window and enjoy your coffee with the view of the slow-moving ships in the harbor.\nOf course, coffee is best enjoyed with music. Go straight after leaving the cafe to find “Geum Su-hyun's Music Salon.” The Gimhae-born Geum Su-hyun, father of the conductor Geum Nan-sae, was an educator and a musician who taught for many years in the Busan area. He is the composer of the famous song “Swing,” a mainstay of music courses in Korean schools. It is said that Geum wrote the song in 15 minutes on a Sunday in 1947, with a flash of inspiration from a poem written by his mother-in-law Kim Mal-bong. \n\nAfter the Korean Independence in 1945, Geum composed “The New Song,” a song sung widely by crowds in independence marches, and the song “August 15” the next year. Geum spent his later life publishing musical publications for the benefit of up-and-coming artists. “Geum Su-hyun’s Music Salon” today is furnished like a small study of a musician, as a homage to Geum’s sizable presence in modern Korean music. Daecheong Sky Observatory in front of the building offers a panoramic view of Sinseondae Terrace, Busanhangdaegyo Bridge, the Korea Maritime & Ocean University, Yeongdo, Bongnaesan Mountain, Yongdusan Park, and Busan Tower. The view is special even by Sanbok Road standards, so make sure to drop by and enjoy the view of the greenery and the city.\nThe road then leads to Daecheong-dong’s Colorful Village, a village that uses colors to express the uniqueness of Busan. The village uses even the manhole covers to create a unique atmosphere, much like an outdoor art museum. Past the stairs decorated with umbrella drawings to find Bosu Book Street. The origins of Bosu Book Street is said to be with a couple who fled the Korean War from the Hamgyeongbuk-do region, whose trade in old magazines and the like inspired others to come together to create the space over time. If there is a scent of knowledge and learning, it must be the scent that one finds in this street. Books arrive here, seemingly drained of life, to be revived and returned to the hands of people. Even today, Bosu Book Street shines with the undeniable value of the act of rediscovering what has been discarded.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Cool winds are felt in the morning and evening these days. It means that the fall season has arrived. Today, we’ve chosen travel sites that go well with the sentiments of the season. From a countless number of attractions filled with the fall vibe, we specifically focus on the color of purple. Now, let’s take a trip to the sentimental, purple-colored travel sites of Busan!\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Daejeo Eco Park</p>One of the most notable parks in Busan that comes to many people’s minds first when they think of fall. Seated in a vast space by the Nakdonggang River, Daejeo Eco Park right now is at its peak in terms of the fall vibe, particularly because of the fully bloomed cosmos found throughout the park announcing that the season has arrived.\n\nJust by looking at these pink cosmos standing underneath the blue sky, we are able to feel the sentiments of fall. The lotus fields located in the middle of the park are where cosmos are seen the most. The flowers modestly have their heads down at one moment and begin to dance along the gentle breeze in the next, emanating such beauty that you cannot help but stop and grab your camera.\nThese days, the Nakdonggang Riverside Park near Gupodaegyo Bridge is filled with pink muhly. A perennial grass species also known as “muhlenbergia capillaris,” pink muhly turns dark pink each fall to produce a fairy tale-like scene. Extremely thin grass come together like pink cotton candy and, as you take a stroll on a path set up between the pink muhly fields, you will feel as if you are walking in the clouds. Take a selfie with a backdrop filled with pink muhly. You will be sure to get a photo of your life with an abundance of fall sentiments.\n\nDaejeo Eco Park\nExit 3, Gangseo-gu Office Station, Subway Line 3 → Transfer to Bus 125 at Gangseo-gu Office → Busan Hyewon School, 8-minute walk\nParking: Daejeo Eco Park Parking Lot (Fees apply)\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Jangnim Port</p>Jangnim Port is a place that’s always mentioned when people choose a location that they think harmonizes most with the blue fall sky. Cute, colorful buildings, which look as if they’re from a fairy tale village, in combination with the fall sky, exude a richly exotic atmosphere. Small boats line up on the water at the port in front of the village, which is connected to the sea. This is Bunezia, the Venezia of Busan that even the original Venezia of Italy would marvel at.\n\nSince it is such a colorful space, focus on the colors and enjoy the trip. You will be able to enjoy Jangnim Port with excitement by trying to find specific colors of red, blue or purple as if you are in a treasure hunt. If you want to find pieces of the fall vibe, we recommend you to look for the color of purple hidden in different corners of the port. You can take even cooler photos by wearing clothes or accessories that are light green, which is in contrast with purple.\n\nAs you make your way to the Bunezia Sunset Observatory located at the entrance of the port, you will be able to see the entire Jangnim Port in a single view. The port seen from above exudes a different kind of charm. As the name suggests, you can enjoy a beautiful sunset in the evening at the Sunset Observatory. It is also a great idea to appreciate Jangnim Port in an elegant fashion together with a cup of fragrant coffee at the cafeteria located inside the observatory.\n\nJangnim Port\nExit 1, Jangnim Station, Subway Line 1 → Transfer to Town Bus Sahagu-5 at Jangrim Elementary School → Jangnimhang Port (Bunezia), 2-minute walk\nParking: Jangnim Port Public Parking Lot (Fees apply)\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Gamcheon Culture Village</p>Gamcheon Culture Village filled with the autumn sunshine is another must-visit attraction for a sentimental fall trip. Cute, toy-like houses densely stand next to one another along the steep hill up to the top, which produces quite an exotic scene. In addition to the unique shapes, their colors are varied and elaborate as well. It is fun to check out and examine these distinct houses one by one. Scenes of people walking through narrow alleyways set up in between the houses are also novel.\n\nYou will find it entertaining going around and trying to find murals and symbols hidden throughout the village. From the Little Prince nonchalantly sitting by a street from where the entire village is seen clearly to a puppy peeking out from behind a wall of a building and even birds sitting atop a roof, there are so many treasures to hunt in the village and half the day will fly by before you realize.\n\nSince this is a village where people actually live, please do not engage in any rowdy or rude behavior. Most of the streets are narrow, which will provide you ample opportunities to use a wide-angle lens.\n\nGamcheon Culture Village\nExit 6, Goejeong Station, Subway Line 1 → Goejeong Sageori‧Kookmin Bank → Transfer to Bus Sahagu-1, Sahagu-1-1 → Gugam, 3-minute walk / \nExit 6, Toseong Station, Subway Line 1 → Transfer to Town Bus Seogu-2 at Pusan National University Hospital → Kamjung Elementary School‧Gamcheon Culture Village, 3-minute walk\nParking: (Former)Kamjung Elementary School Public Parking Lot (Fees apply)\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Huinnyeoul Coastal Tunnel</p>Huinnyeoul Culture Village in Yeongdo boasts a scenery as exotic as Gamcheon Culture Village. Since it is located on a coastal cliff just above the sea, it offers visitors a view that is comparable to Santorini, Greece. While looking out at large ocean-going ships anchored in the sea by the village, it will make you feel as if you are on some foreign island. Will there be a better place to enjoy the rich taste of the port city of Busan?\n\nAnother attraction has recently been established in Huinnyeoul Culture Village. This new attraction is the Huinnyeoul Coastal Tunnel you will reach at the end of a stroll on Jeoryeong Coastal Trail by the beach beneath the cliffs. This average-length tunnel became famous thanks to a silhouette photo taken with the tunnel as the frame and the sea in the backdrop. Tourists from all over the country and the world continue to visit to check out this unique scenery, which makes you feel as if you are inside a magical sea cave. Make sure not to skip past the photo zone set up inside the tunnel. Leave a proper record of the memories made during a trip to Busan in front of the purple-colored artwork.\n\nHuinnyeoul Coastal Tunnel\nExit 6, Nampo Station, Subway Line 1 → Transfer to Bus 508, 71, or 7 at Yeongdodaegyo Bridge (Nampo Station) → Baengnyeonsa Temple, 5-minute walk\nParking: Sinseon 3-dong Public Parking Lot (Fees apply)\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Busanhangdaegyo Bridge</p>Busanhangdaegyo Bridge, which has become the symbol of Busan along with Gwangandaegyo Bridge, attracts tourists every night with fancy lights radiating red, blue, green and purple. The lights of Busanhangdaegyo that brightly illuminate the dusky city and those radiated from the port where large ships are anchored are sure to stimulate certain emotions in tourists.\n\nThe bridge can be viewed from not only Yeongdo but also Busan Station, Sanbok Road, Hwangnyeongsan Mountain and anywhere from which the old Busanhang Port is seen. Particularly in Yeongdo’s Cheonghak-dong Reservoir Observatory and Cheonghak Waterside Park, the beautiful nightscape of the bridge can be enjoyed right in front of your eyes. The colorful nightscape is best seen not when it is too dark but about 30 minutes after the sun sets.\n\nBusanhangdaegyo Bridge\nExit 6, Nampo Station, Subway Line 1, Transfer to Bus 113, 30, 8, 190, 186, or 88 at Yeongdodaegyo Bridge → Cheonghak Market, 13-minute walk to the waterfront underneath Busanhangdaegyo Bridge\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "A road where one walks alone is beautiful. Each step that one takes is imbued with the power of the earth, each thing passing by a stoic moment of farewell. The scent of grass fills the road with the expectation of life to come. When one steps freely without being beholden to anything, it is perfectly okay to hesitate, for no matter where one goes, one’s steps will bring one to sceneries untold. There lies history unknown, and thoughts untapped. That’s why it is so beautiful to walk alone. Here are some of the roads in Busan where one can walk alone.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Thinking back to the bloody year on Dongnaeeupseong Trail</p>Busan was the first place in Korea to feel the destruction and death brought by the Imjin War, the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592. Dongnae Historical Park is a place where one can trace the history of the war. After nearly 400 years, the blood of the battlefield has already been washed away, replaced by an idyllic refuge for the people of Busan. The trail starts from Insaengmun Gate of Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town. The gate has an interesting name: “Life” According to local folklore, refugees who fled the invasion through the pass upon which Insaengmun Gate stands are all said to have survived the brutalities of the invasion. When one passes through the gate and follows the road, one meets a forest trail. Beyond the small hill lies a massive structure that resembles a pyramid This is the Busan March First Independence Movement Monument. Its construction began on August 15, 1995, the 50th anniversary of Korean Independence, and was completed on March 1 the following year. The juxtaposition of the horrors of the Imjin War and the defiance of the Korean people, exemplified by the March First Independence Movement Monument, gives on a glimpse into the recurring message in Korean history.\n\nThe path beyond leads to Bukjangdae Command Post, a historical command post. Because of its characteristics, it offers the best view of the area around Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town. When one stands on the command post, one can see the skyline of the city beyond the fortifications, stretching from Jangsan Mountain to Hwangnyeongsan Mountain and Geumjeongbong Peak. Enjoy the open view, and follow the walls where history lives on to the North Gate, the only gate in Dongnaeeupseong Walled Town that retains its original appearance. Follow the gentle hills to reach Seojangdae Command Post, a building retaining the beauty of hanok. This is not the end of the walk. The area near Dongnae Historical Park has many other places to see, including the Dongnae-bu Magistrate's Office, Dongnaeeupseong History Hall, Jang Yeong-sil Science Garden, Ancient Tombs in Bokcheon-dong, Dongnaehyanggyo Local Confucian School, and Chungnyeolsa Shrine. Where to head next, I wonder. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Follow the trail to find yourself at Beomeosa Trail</p>Beomeosa Trail is made up of four sections (2.3km), namely the Space of Emptying (Section 1), Space of Meditation (Section 2), Becoming One with Nature (Section 3), and Peace of Heart (Section 4). The trail starts from Beomeosa Temple. Said to be founded by the Great Monk Uisang in the Silla Period, Beomeosa Temple is said to be one of the three foremost temples of the Gyeongnam region, along with Haeinsa Temple and Tongdosa Temple. It is also known as the temple where Manhae Han Yong-un, a respected independence activist and poet, spent a part of his life: the temple is accordingly considered as a starting point of the March 1st Independence Movement in the Busan area. I become a pilgrim and circle the temple grounds to empty my heart of clutter. Walking in a tranquil mountain monastery is always a calming and soothing experience. After leaving Beomeosa Temple, follow the curved roads to find the Beomeosa Trail signboard. A narrow path winds into the nearby forest. When one climbs onto the wooden deck, one immediately feels the refreshing air of the forest. The rhythmical sound of water flowing imparts its tune into one’s steps. One can step down into the valley and embrace the soothing coolness of the water, or head to Beomnidan-gil Street for its collection of cafes inside the forest. \n\nOtherwise, follow the road to find the Meditation Space. This expansive circular deck is a great place to enjoy a forest bath, or close one’s eyes to turn one’s gaze inward. In the darkness, one feels the branches in the wind, the singing birds, and the things one had not realized before to be closer than ever to one’s heart. I open my eyes and turn my gaze to the scenery of Beomeosa Trail. Unfortunately, it is almost time to descend from the mountain.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Follow the history on Geumgang Park Hiking Trail</p>Geumgang Park is located below Geumjeongsan Mountain. Its moniker, “the Lesser Geumgang,” comes from the visitors marveling at its beauty. Geumgang Park’s cable car system has been the most popular site for people to enjoy the view of Busan. \n\nWhen one follows the pine forest trail from the main gate of Geumgang Park, one finds a number of monuments, including one dedicated to the pioneer of modern Korean medicine Ji Seok-yeong. Another monument is dedicated to the souls lost to the brutalities of Japanese imperialism. There must be a reason as to why this monument is located in Geumgang Park. Indeed, following the trail to the badminton court toward the summit brings one to a signboard detailing the historical sites related to Japanese imperialist violence in Geumgang Park. One then finds the former site of Dokjindaeamun Gate and Geumgang Pond. Geumgang Park actually originates from Dongnae Geumgangwon, a private garden established by Japanese tobacco tycoon Higashibara Gajiro in the 1920s. Higashibara used the water from the valley to build a Japanese-style pond and a tower. He was also the one who established the monument for the 2600th anniversary of the founding of Japanese Imperial Rule. Higashibara even relocated Dokjindaeamun Gate, rebuilt by the Magistrate of Dongnae Jeong Hyeon-deok, under the pretense of urban reorganization to his garden. The reason why Geumgang Park bears these traces is because Geumgang Park was intended to be a center of the region’s tourism with the opening of Dongnae Hot Springs. \n\nI swallow the bitter taste in my mouth, and start walking toward the mountain once more. The climb is quite difficult until one reaches Neoreok Rock, a place famous for its scenic views. Past that is cable car station. There’s a convenience store next to the station, so one can purchase some drinks to quench one’s thirst. The way down leads toward Cheongnyongsa and Sorimsa Temples. At the end of the road, one finds the Tombs of Patriotic Martyrs of the Imjin War in Dongnae, a communal grave of defenders who fell during the defense of Busan in the Imjin War. \n\nAs I step out of the main gate, I look back to my lone walk, a time that allowed me to step closer to history because I was alone.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "One who does not see the city at night has not truly visited the city of Busan. This city, surrounded by mountains and the sea, truly shines only when the sun goes down. The views of the city lights, falling like a curtain over the sea and hemmed in with mountains like an inviting hearth, certainly matches up to the views of other famous cities like Hong Kong and Singapore; in fact, in some ways, the views are even more exotic than such famous cities. The bus tour offers a perfect and comfortable way to enjoy the various charms of Busan at night. Check out the Bridge Tour course, the Night View Tour course offered by the Busan City Tour Bus! \n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Bridge Tour Course at Busan City Tour Bus</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Busan Station (starting point) → Busandaegyo Bridge → Busanhangdaegyo Bridge → Gwangalli Beach (photo time) → Suyeong Bridge No. 2 → Busanhangdaegyo Bridge → Gwangandaegyo Bridge → Busan Museum of Art • BEXCO → Haeundae Beach → Marine City → Namhangdaegyo Bridge → Songdo Cloud Trails (photo time) → Jagalchi • Gukje Market → Busan Station (end point) </p>\nThe Bridge Tour Course of the Busan City Tour Bus starts from Busan Station once every Friday and Saturday evening.

Just the thought alone is almost enough for one to start packing one’s travel bag. \n\nWhile a nighttime drive in Busan is certainly a part of any tourist’s itinerary in the city, it may be out of reach for people like first-timers, backpackers, and solo travelers. They need not despair, however, as the Busan City Tour Bus offers a safe and comfortable chance to go on a drive through its Bridge Tour course! One Korean poet said that “one has to look closely to see that it is pretty.” Indeed, the Bridge Tour allows you to see the scenery more closely and in detail than when you are the one doing the driving. \n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Lights like the Milky Way, just out of my reach </p>The Bridge Tour offers its participants a great chance to see the famous beauty of Busan’s bridges, like Gwangandaegyo Bridge, Busandaegyo Bridge, and Busanhangdaegyo Bridge, up close. It feels as if one could reach out and grasp the brilliant beauty of these bridges. As one passes the bridge, illuminated by LED lights, one feels as if one is stepping into a fantastical world: a world of future, just like in the movies.\n\nWe haven’t even talked about the lights that fill the harbor! The symphony of light, reflected on the night sea, and the graceful skyline made up of towering skyscrapers come together to create a simply unforgettable picture. The lights that bathe the landmarks in gentle lighting invoke happiness just by their existence. This is the romantic side of Busan that shines brighter than the day. \n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">A spoonful of romance, two spoons of love, photo times </p>The 2 hour 30 minute-long Bridge Tour is sufficient to cover most of Busan’s most famous sights. This means that you can see the must-visit sights of Busan in just one day! Of course, what’s a trip without photographs? Participants of the Bridge Tour get 10-minute photo opportunity times at Gwangalli Beach and Songdo Cloud Trail. The view of Busan at night from a double decker bus? It is a romantic view that one cannot help but feel with one’s heart.\n\nDon’t forget that the Bridge Tour hours are subject to change depending on the weather and the traffic. \n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Taejongdae Park is one of the most famous tourist sites in Busan. Because of how old and famous the park is, it tends to fly under the radar for many tourists who are familiar with Busan. However, the park actually holds a secret that even the most knowledgeable Busan native may not know. It is a place where one can encounter a primordial slice of nature, unsullied with human touch: The Taejongdae Secret Forest. Let’s journey into the heart of this mysterious forest!\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Taejongdae Secret Forest</p>Taejongsan Mountain makes up the majority of the Taejongdae Recreation Area. Due to its status as a protected area, even the natives of Busan often have no idea that this place exists, compounded by the area being closed off to public for half a year for forest fire prevention. It is truly a “Secret Forest” known only to the select few.\n\nThe gateway to Taejongdae Secret Forest is hidden near the entrance to the Taejongdae Recreation Area, in the form of an unassuming stone staircase that I have never recognized throughout my many visits to Taejongdae Park. I climb the stairs and follow the forest trail along the right-hand side to find the Taejongdae Secret Forest trail.\n\nThe forest trail, which starts from the entrance to Taejongdae Park, goes through the forest behind Beobyungsa Temple to reach the cliff, from which one can see the Korea Maritime & Ocean University and the Oryukdo Islets. From there, it leads one to Taejongsa Temple. The total length of the trail stretches 3.5km, laid out in a circle around Taejongsan Mountain, taking about 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours to complete.\nJust as I feel my brows cooling from my sweat, I notice the salty sea breeze entering my nostrils. This is the starting point of the cliffside road, which overlooks the shoreline.\n\nThis narrow road, fenced in with barbed wires, takes one into a forest that seems to be completely untouched by the human hand. One runs into a massive fernbrake colony, then a mossy valley, with large boulders blocking one’s way. An interesting feature of the forest is the prevalence of pteridophytes, which gives the forest an exotic scenery rarely found in Korea I simply find it surprising that such forests still remain in Busan.\nAs one enjoys the mysteries of the primordial forest along the narrow and winding path, one comes to an open space where one’s left-hand side is no longer blocked by barbed wires. Here, one has a panoramic view of the North Port, Sinseondae Pier, Oryukdo Islets, and Haeundae, with the Korea Maritime & Ocean University appearing so close that one feels as if one could grasp it.\n\nOne cannot help but stop in one’s tracks to enjoy the view. The breeze brings with it the fresh scent of the sea. I never expected to find such a wonderful view in Taejongdae. Come to think of it, I don’t recall running into anyone in the Secret Forest. It feels as if I had the entire trail to myself.\nI turn away and follow the road to find a steep slope. Here the dirt trail turns into a rocky path, and the surrounding environment also become unwelcoming. For these reasons, I recommend visitors to make some preparations for their safety. At the very least, water and a sturdy pair of hiking shoes are a must. One must be especially careful near areas that lack wire fences, as one careless step could send one plunging below.\n\nJust as I feel short of breath, I find myself once again on the gentle forest trail, with a small cave to the right. This is no work of nature; it is a work of human hands. Despite its small size, barely housing three or four people, the cave seems bigger than I expected inside.\n\nPast the cave is Taejong Guard Post, just before the end of the trail. When one arrives at the wire fences, confusion settles in seeing that the road disappears. Here, one needs to step toward the right side along the wire fence to find a paved road, which leads to Taejongsa Temple.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Taejongsa Temple</p>Taejongsa Temple, the final stop for the mysterious trip in Taejongdae Secret Forest, was established in 1970. Daeungjeon Hall, Sansingak Hall, and other buildings of the temple blend into the surroundings of the alluring Taejongsan Mountain with their dignified atmosphere.\n\nWhile this temple lacks the history other more famous temples have in the area, Taejongsa Temple has received nationwide fame thanks to its bigleaf hydrangea colony. Every late July, the bigleaf hydrangea bloom into brilliant colors that transform the area into a completely different world. The sheer number of bigleaf hydrangea flowers makes the temple appear to be buried in the flowers. These flowers draw visitors from all across Korea and even from abroad during the Hydrangea Festival.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Gamji Beach</p>When one climbs down from Taejongsa Temple, one meets Taejongdae Scenic Road. One can find the entrance to the Taejongdae Recreation Area to the right, while the left side leads to Yeongdo Lighthouse, the observatory, and eventually to the Taejongdae Recreation Area entrance area. If you have some time to spare, take the road on the left to enjoy the view of Yeongdo Lighthouse and the observatory: they are great places to enjoy the view of Taejongdae’s shoreline, which has even been designated as a UNESCO Geopark.\nFollowing the road to the left of the Recreation Area entrance brings one to Gamji Beach. Gamji Beach is one of the pebble beaches located around Taejongdae Park, appreciated for its open view and the blue sea. Here, one can take a cruise ship to enjoy the view of Taejongdae Park from the sea. Don’t miss the grilled clam restaurants nearby for a romantic experience of dining by the sea, especially with a cup of soju.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Busan is a beloved location for movies and K-dramas. One such web drama, Cafe Midnight, is set in the Sanbok Road region of Busan. Its popularity has led to the drama being extended to three seasons, and a film being prepared for release. Busan Tourism Organization and the producers of Cafe Midnight have prepared a special tour for the fans of the drama, the “Cafe Midnight Tour,” where the characters in the drama serve as tour guides and introduce the hidden sights and history of Busan.\nDae-cheol, the comic relief and arguably a breakout character for the web drama, leads the participants to the filming sites featured in Cafe Midnight with interesting tidbits from Busan’s history and culture, ending with a special screening of the show. Indeed, many fans of the drama have already taken part in the tour, and satisfaction has been quite high. The tour starts from Busan Station. Meet up with your fellow travelers and start the tour with Dae-cheol! Ibagu-gil Road lies just a crossing away from Busan Station.\nThe first spot on the tour itinerary is Brown Hands Baekje, the setting for the feature episode of Cafe Midnight. This handsome cafe is situated in the restored and remodeled Baekje Hospital building, which was originally built in 1927. Because it is registered as Registered Cultural Heritage No. 647, the building still retains its floors and exterior quite well. Indeed, the gate to the building is a wonderful place to take a picture for its charming combination of retro style and contemporary architecture.\nFollowing the Ibagu-gil Road brings one to the Mural Alley, which details the history of the Choryang-dong area. Black-and-white pictures on the school walls offer a window into historical Busan. The origins of the village go back to 1950, the year of the Korean War. War refugees made their way to Busan to flee the war, and began to settle in ramshackle shantytowns built on steep slopes with winding staircases. Sadly, many of the refugees were unable to return to their hometowns after the war. In that sense, Choryang-dong’s Ibagu-gil Road can be said to have been created by the tragedy that befell the war refugees.\nAfter the Mural Alley, one finds oneself in front of a dizzyingly high and long staircase. Because there are 168 steps, this staircase is known as the 168 Stairs. It is the quickest path from Sanbok Road to the Port of Busan. While today’s 168 Stairs is also served by a monorail system, many of the area’s residents in the past were forced to climb the steep stairs on the way to their work at the Port of Busan or the factories, or even to draw water from the well. When one looks up to the staircase from below, it feels as if one can feel the massive burden of life on one’s shoulders.\n\nTour participants stop here to listen to the history of Choryang-dong and see the filming spots featured in Cafe Midnight. Fans of the drama will enjoy the chance to take pictures at the same angles that were featured in the show.\nA trip on the monorail system brings one to the view of not only the winding alleyways of the neighborhood and the houses, but also the Port of Busan and Busanhangdaegyo Bridge. When one disembarks from the monorail, one immediately comes to an observatory with an open view of the Busan sea.\nIbagu-gil Road is particularly valuable for the fans of Cafe Midnight, as the protagonists of the TV show commute to their school along the road. On the way up, there’s a spot called Dangsan, where people hold rites for the prosperity and peace of village.\nOne then takes a bus to Choryang 1941 and Ibagu Camp. The two sites and their wonderful views of the area from the top of the Sanbok Road area are featured in the show as well. Because of the wonderful views, a guesthouse and a number of accommodation facilities were built in this area. After their completion, they immediately established themselves as places with great views on Korean SNS channels.\nParticipants here try to replicate the shots shown on the drama, unable to hide their smiles and joy. Many participants actually reported that this spot, at the top of Sanbok Road, was the place where they fell in love with Busan; this place, where the past and present of Busan meet, is certainly a special place for visitors to Busan.\nAfter spending some time at Ibagu Camp, the group then moves to Yeongju Sky Eye Observatory. This is certainly a standout among the various observatories located on Sanbok Road, especially for its simply breathtaking panoramic view of the area, so it is a must-visit place for travelers in Busan.\nThe view from the observatory encompasses everything from the winding Sanbok Road to Sinseondae Terrace in Nam-gu, Busanhangdaegyo Bridge, Bongnaesan Mountain in Yeongdo-gu, and Busan Tower in Jung-gu. The view laid out below is a mosaic of the past and the present, from old public apartments to houses built on terraces and high-rise buildings.\n\nWhether it be portrait or scenery photography, one is guaranteed to bring home a picture of one’s life from Yeongju Sky Eye Observatory. Indeed, I recommend heading to this observatory to see the most authentic scenery of Busan.\nThe sun is setting, and the night is inching into the area. The tour group moves to the eponymous “Cafe Midnight” featured in the drama, Haein Cafe. One passes through a vine tunnel to access the charming view at Haein Cafe.\nHere, the group enjoys a delicious dinner with coffee and beverages featured in the drama. Some participants quickly finish their dinner and go on into the vine tunnel to leave their photographs, just like the protagonists in the drama.\nThe view from Haein Cafe overlooks Songdo Beach, where gentle lighting and forests come together to create a beautiful view at night.From the history of Sanbok and Ibagu-gil Road to the wonderful scenery along the way, there is no risk of boredom.\nThe tour ends with a screening of Cafe Midnight at the Corner Theater, and a Q&A session with the director of the show.\nThe participants get together for a final group shot at the Baegwol photo zone as the very final step in the Cafe Midnight Tour. All stops on the tour hold up excellently on their own and are perfect for introducing the charms of Busan to travelers, so those who are planning their own trip can take some cues from the itinerary. All proceeds from this tour event will be donated to Miaewon, the oldest orphanage in the Busan area located on Sanbok Road, so one can walk away knowing that the tour has been of benefit to other folks as well.\n\nCafe Midnight Tour <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bfqGD7H9qk\" target=\"_blank\" alt=\"새창열림\" class=\"link-style1\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bfqGD7H9qk</a>\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "It's now time to tell you the fifth story. Today, meet Dalmajigil Road, which one should definitely not miss when visiting Haeundae. Dalmajigil, a hilly road from Mipo at the end of Haeundae to Songjeong Beach, is a place for healing in nature away from the hustle and bustle of the city by absorbing oneself in meditation and relaxation. One can see the clear blue sky and the azure sea in the fall season. The best of what fall has to offer still remains with the beautiful and vivid fall colors from the leaves. The reason why one loves Haeundae in the fall! It is now time to leave to Dalmajigil Road!\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Dalmaji Eoul Madang</p>Situated a bit away from Haeundae Beach, one can feel a totally different atmosphere in the air. One is embraced by the tranquil, peaceful energy, breaking away from the tense energy of skyscrapers. The road along the beach leads one to a trail through a thick forest. The moonlight guides one to the romantic trail along Moontan Road.\n\nIt is nice to take a walk along Moontan Road to Dalmaji Eoul Madang, where today’s trip begins, but it is better to go by public transportation or car to adjust your pace. Dalmaji Eoul Madang, which is not very far from Dalmaji Hill, where Haewoljeong Pavilion is located, has a fantastic stage with a view of the blue East Sea and an auditorium matched in harmony with the surrounding forest. It is just like a small island floating peacefully on the sea. One cannot look away from the amphitheater that blends in perfectly with nature and makes one feel at home. Various cultural events are regularly held at Dalmaji Eoul Madang like the “Dalmaji Humanities Festival,” and the “Dalmaji Concert.” See the full moon lit over Dalmaji Eoul Madang, which becomes a magically beautiful place at night.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Path Through of Speculation</p>After going down to Dalmaji Eoul Madang and walking around the stage and the auditorium, you can go back to Dalmajigil Road. Walk right into the Trail of Speculation, passing by a sign that looks like a round full moon. Unlike Dalmajigil Road, which is crowded with lines of cars and people, the path is tranquil and quiet as if you were alone in the world. The path is only about ten meters away from Dalmajigil Road but is a totally different place.\n\nThe path is only used by those exercising or taking a walk. Few tourists are likely to pass you by on this path. The true Damajigil Road starts here, where locals visit. The festival of green greets you as soon as you enter the path. You are surrounded by the color green. The flora around the path lets out phytoncide, which flows through your body when you inhale and exhale the fresh air. Feeling like you are in a deep forest, you have to look around to remind yourself of reality.\nThe fall deepens around you. Yellow leaves boast themselves in the Path Through of Speculation. Not being as showy as the autumn leaves, it is well enough to feel autumn at your side. Crickets sing from somewhere around you, and the vague sound of waves tingle your ears. You might feel as if you were unburdened by walking the path for about 10 minutes.\n\nFew people know there is such a wonderful forest path near Haeundae Beach. The path is flat enough for everyone, and lights along the road make the path safe at night. The road to Cheongsapo appears when the path ends, although you find yourself wanting to stay on the cozy path. Now it is time to head toward Haemaru, going back to Dalmajigil Road.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Dalmajigil Road</p>Turning back from the Haewoljeongsa Temple Bus Stop, go back to the crossroad in front of Cheongsapo to join Dalmajigil Road again. Standing on the bridge across the crossroad you will find Cheongsapo in front of you with two lighthouses facing each other and the blue sea beneath your feet. The fascinating and stunning view would make anyone stop and stare. Cooling yourself with the breeze from the sea, walk toward Songjeong.\n\nCars continue to pass you by along the wavy Dalmajigil Road. Dalmajigil Road is well-known as the best road for driving in Busan. In spring, the entire Dalmajigil Road is transformed to a tunnel of cherry blossoms thanks to the cherry trees lined along the road. The night with cherry blossom petals on the wind. It is inevitable to feel romantic when you drive along Dalmajigil Road.\nYou can see the blue sea here and there among roadside trees as the elevation increases. A small observatory was built in the wide open space on the way to Haemaru. Before the memory of walking in the deep forest fades away, you find yourself trekking along the blue sea. Looking back on the way you have come, the buildings densely packed on Dalmaji Hill look close to you.\n\nThe sun sets slowly down to the west, turning pale and dim. You arrive in front of Haemaru. The warm and soft sunlight starts to dye the world with a golden hue. Dalmajigil Road turns golden. The wooden stairs lead you to Haemaru, today’s final destination. The angle of the sun reveals a slightly different view at every step on the stairs.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Haeundae Haemaru</p>Haemaru has the best view on Dalmajigil Road, with its meaning of “the top of the mountain that greets the sunrise first.” In remembrance of the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting hosted in Busan, Haemaru was constructed in 2005 as a two-story observatory with a traditional pavilion. The view from here covers Dalmaji Hill, Cheongsapo, and Haeundae, as well as Oryukdo Islets. You can also see Tsushima Island if the weather allows.\n\nUpon arriving at Haemaru, the sun has fallen to the top of Dalmaji Hill. The round sun slowly sets down, drawing an arc to the downtown area, and soon disappears. With the light of the sun gone, Dalmajigil Road prepares for the night to come by turning on its roadside lights. It is stunning to see the panoramic view of Dalmaji from the pavilion. The view almost tastes sweet and pleasurable, although not being as splendid as Marine City. One cannot help but wonder what the night on Dalmaji Hill would be like under a full moon.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Before you realize, green leaves turn yellow and red, and fall has reached its peak. And, once the leaves in the colors of autumn begin to fall one by one, the fleeting season will come to an abrupt end. Every moment is too precious to be sitting at home and merely looking out the window. So how about going on a light walking trip? You don’t have to travel far; anywhere that has a cool river breeze and the rich vibe of the autumn season is a wonderful place to walk. Now, let’s go to the riverside trails of Busan, a great city for walks.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Oncheoncheon Trail</p>Just as Seoul has Cheonggyecheon, Busan has Oncheoncheon. Originating in Geumjeong-gu and flowing through Dongnae-gu and Yeonje-gu, Oncheoncheon Stream has a trail along its water route and is one of the most beloved stream trails of Busan locals. Do not let its location in the city center conjure up thoughts of mediocrity. As you walk along the stream, it is not uncommon to see wild animals that are rarely found in cities, such as otters, gray herons and egrets. Also, the elegant street of cafes under the Oncheoncheon trees provides cool relaxation in summer and a warm cup of coffee in winter.\nBut this is not the only reason that Oncheoncheon is so loved by many. The true beauty of the stream lies in its changing scenery in all four seasons. The unknown wildflowers along Oncheoncheon and the old cherry trees standing on top of a hill change to new clothes every season. Upon arrival of the season in which the colorful maple leaves fall by the cold wind, the color of autumn permeates through the stream like a painting. In a season that feels more beautiful because of its short presence, let’s walk through the painting-like scenery.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Suyeonggang Riverside Trail</p>In the midst of high-rise buildings that seemingly touch the sky, there is a place where you can feel the cool river breeze that will clear up your mind and heart. This place is the Suyeonggang Riverside Trail. A part of the Busan Galmaetgil Trail 8-2 that goes from Dongcheongyo Bridge to Jwasuyeonggyo Bridge and Millakgyo Bridge, the Suyeonggang Riverside Trail is level and gentle so it is perfect for a light stroll. The clear sky, cool breeze and trail enriched by autumn present you with a momentary rest within the busy city center. \nIf you like to enjoy some speed rather than a slow walk, grab your bike and ride along the Suyeonggang Riverside Trail. The Suyeonggang riverside, which flows peacefully along its curves, offers not only clean water and cool air but also a well-built bike path. Autumn, a season with cool wind, is the best season to ride a bike! Let’s fully enjoy the season as we cut through the cool autumn breeze. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Nakdonggang Riverside Trail<p>The Nakdonggang estuary finally meets with the sea after a long journey and, as you stand next to the gently flowing river, you feel refreshed by the cool breeze blowing from across the river. The Nakdonggang Riverside Trail can be accessed simply by coming over a river bank from downtown Busan, which is why it is full of people who come out for a walk or a picnic under the cool fall wind. It is also a great place to “gaze at the water and space out” under the cool shade of a tree while listening to the sound from the river. \nThe reed fields suddenly produce a golden wave because of wind that came from an invisible source. The fall scenery of Nakdonggang riverside sways the heart of those who see it. Around this time every year, the reeds fluttering by the river breeze form a golden spectacle, grabbing the attention of many people. If you haven’t gotten a chance to enjoy the season because of your busy schedule, how about visiting the Nakdonggang Riverside Trail and capturing the final moments of autumn this year? \n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "There are hidden travel spots throughout Busan where you can encounter the culture and history of villages with beautiful scenery in the backdrop, especially the arts and culture villages that tell of colorful and artistic stories on each alley and street.\nThe fall season where the cool wind blows is perfect for you to go on an arts and culture street tour. From “Kangkangee Culture Village” with an affectionate name to Hocheon Culture Village and Lee Jung-seob Street, let’s visit these open, roofless art museums we have found in Busan.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Kangkangee Culture Village</p>Located across from Jagalchi Market, Kangkangee Culture Village is also known as the “shipyard village.” The area if the former home of “Tanaka Shipyard,” which manufactured the nation’s first-ever ships with engines, as well as the mecca of the repair shipbuilding business. Once-forgotten town because of the aging population, it was reborn under the name of “Kangkangee Culture Village” along with the restoration of Yeongdodaegyo Bridge. Today, the area is full of a variety of exciting elements such as regular tours, cruises and ship experiences. It is also a popular weekend travel spot for Busan locals and a must-visit attraction for Busan travelers.\n“Kangkangee Information Center,” which can be said to be where the village starts, is being utilized as a terminal for ship experiences and marine tours. Here, you can book a ticket on a cruise ship called Kangkangee Sea Bus and enjoy a relaxing trip. Living up to the name as a culture village, Kangkangee Sea Bus boasts fancy colors and glides through the waters. From the cruise on the sea, you can get a panoramic view of the shipyard and the village.\nThe cruise is just one of the impressive attractions of Kangkangee Culture Village. Check out the “Colorful Street” right in front of Kangkangee Information Center. Colorful Street is a street created by newly painting the walls of old warehouses and service centers as a part of the Wall Art Project. As a result, a unique street whose fancy, colorful buildings grab people’s attention was created and, today, it has been reborn as a place where you have to take selfies. It is no exaggeration to say that Colorful Street has served a huge role in transforming a “town that had been repairing ships” for a long period of time into a “village with arts and culture.”\nAs you start walking from Colorful Street towards different corners of the village, you will be able to enjoy street cartoons known as the “Pole Art Project.” Different cartoon cuts are drawn on telephone poles that are easily found on streets, and they tell stories of the past and present of Kangkangee Culture Village. \nThe history of the village can be examined in more detail if you visit the “Street Museum” where the countless changes by era that the village has experienced and endured from the beginning to the present day are drawn on ordinary walls. The village’s history flows along the walls. Once you walk past the Street Museum and move towards the sea, you can get a view of many of Busan’s landmarks, including Yeongdodaegyo Bridge, Jagalchi Market, Busan Tower and Yongdusan Park. It is also a great place to space out while gazing at the sea, motorboats traveling through the waters, and the waves rocking back and forth.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Lee Jung-seob Street</p>Do you know Lee Jung-seob, a genius artist who represents not only Dong-gu, Busan but also Korea? Lee Jung-seob is famous for being the creator of “White Ox” and silver foil drawings on tin foil inside a cigarette pack, and there is a street in Busan that has splendidly displayed the works of Artist Lee Jung-seob.\nEstablished in Beomil-dong, Dong-gu in Busan, Lee Jung-seob Street wonderfully expresses the works and world view of Artist Lee Jung-seob on stairs and walls. Not many know that there is an art-filled neighborhood in such a small village in the city where people frequently come and go, but this is where “Lee Jung-seob Street” exists.\nTo fully enjoy Lee Jung-seob Street with a deeper understanding of the artist, it would be a good idea to learn a little bit about the artist before you visit the area. Lee roamed the area around Mildawon, Geumgang Coffee Shop and pubs by the wharf in the Gwangbok-dong area. Together with other artists who had fled to Busan, they made significant contributions to Korean arts. Though he lived as an impoverished artist drawing on silver foil paper inside cigarette packs, he produced world-renowned works like <White Ox>, <Bull> and <Scenery of Beomil-dong> and is remembered as an artist with the nickname of genius painter. \nWhen you stand at the entrance of the street and look towards the view above, what grabs your attention before anything else is the \"staircase murals.\" The artist's famous works are painted on each and every step. If you look at the stairs from the front, the paintings come to form a single, complete mural artwork. These are difficult stairs to climb but, as you look at the paintings and take one step at a time, you will be able to reach the top before you realize. At the highest point of the staircase, you can relax and enjoy the view below.\nAt the rest area in the middle of the staircase, chairs and wall structures that pay homage to Lee's works are installed to allow visitors to appreciate and examine his artistic sense in a unique way. While walking up the steps, you can come to meet Lee Jung-seob's art works in a variety of forms from murals to installation art and tile art, which will make you feel as if you are in an art gallery.\nLee Jung-seob Observatory located at the end of the staircase is where you will have a panoramic view of Beomil-dong. It is a small observatory but it still boasts beautiful scenery that anyone would fall in love with. Here, you can briefly rest or take photos to make good memories. Also, the observatory is an attractive location from which you can enjoy a complete view of \"Hocheon Village,\" another art museum without a roof in Busan, in a relaxing manner. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Hocheon Village</p>Do you know the location of \"Hocheon Village\"? Once an ordinary town, it has become a must-visit spot during a trip to Busan. Just a few years ago, the village did not see many people visiting the area. However, ever since it became known as a filming location for a drama, it started to gain fame and, now, Hocheon Village is one of the tourist attractions that represent Busan.\nIf you actually visit Hocheon Village yourself, you will find something greater and more colorful than a mere \"drama filming location.\" This is a village that had already been boasting a long history, brilliant culture and beautiful scenery even before being a filming location.\nThe village features houses standing along Sanbok Road that continues in curves and bends, and the colors of the roofs and walls form gorgeous harmony. The view of Hocheon Village during the day is filled with gentle but splendid paint-like colors. \nThe name, Hocheon Village, originated from Hogyecheon, a stream that flows through the village whose name means a stream to which a tiger used to come to drink. This is why you can easily run into tiger paintings in different places of the village. The tiger mural street is painted with tiger murals and tells their stories on every wall of the houses. As you slowly walk through the village roads, you will be able to enjoy story-filled tiger paintings.\nNear the refreshingly flowing water of Hogyecheon, you find “Eoseulleong Art Museum,” which is where calligraphy classes are held for residents of Hocheon Village and nearby areas and, also, where the completed works are exhibited. Depending on the period of the year, Eoseulleong Art Museum may be exhibiting artwork. \nPeople walk on the deck trail built along Hogyecheon and capture diverse scenes of the village with their eyes. At the end of a diligent walk, you will reach 180 Stairs, famous for its appearance in the drama, <Fight For My Way>. The 180 Stairs viewed from below look so tall that it feels as if they can touch the sky but, once you start walking up the steps, you will be mesmerized by the wonderful scenery of the village that unfolds behind you. \n“Hocheon Cultural Platform” awaits you at the top of the staircase and this is where a replica of “Namil Bar” from the drama, <Fight For My Way>, is set up. It has been widely loved by those who stop by this area as a must-visit photo zone to take selfies of their lives. \nThe view of the village seen from Hocheon Cultural Platform is like a beautiful painting. Come and visit Hocheon Village, a roofless art museum filled with things to see from the gorgeous village landscape to 180 Stairs, murals and art galleries, anytime.\n\n\n"

Haeundae, Gwangalli and Gijang are considered the most famous vacation spots of Busan but “Songdo,” located at the southern tip of the city, is rising as a romantic travel site for the fall season. From Amnam Park with its gorgeous and blue seascape to Busan Air Cruise crossing over the waters and Songdo Beach known as Napoli of the East! Let’s go on a one-day trip to Songdo.\n\nWatch the video of Songdo, a safe travel destination in Busan,\ntraveled by Seoul Walker <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDiq3JzI1hg \" target=\"_blank\" alt=\"새창열림\" class=\"link-style1\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDiq3JzI1hg</a>\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Amnam Park</p>Amnam Park is one of Songdo’s landmarks from which the gorgeous scenery of the blue sea is viewed through a thickly wooded pine forest along a narrow trail. Consisting of steep rocks and cliffs forming unique shapes, Amnam Park features observation decks and benches throughout the park to allow people to enjoy the beauty of Songdo sea that spreads out like a painting. It is a great place to trek for about an hour while feeling the cool sea breeze.\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Songdo Yonggung Suspension Bridge</p>Songdo Yonggung Suspension Bridge connects Amnam Park and Dongseom, a small uninhabited island across the sea from the park. The floor is made of wire mesh, which gives you a thrilling feeling as if you are walking over the sea. The circular trail, which continues along Dongseom, offers a panoramic view that contains the refreshing scenery of Songdo sea, beautiful landscape built by rocks and cliffs, and the colorful cable cars flying through the sky.\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Busan Air Cruise</p>Take a ride on the Busan Air Cruise if you wish to see the wide open view of Songdo from high in the sky. I can assure you that this cable car is like no other you have rode on so far. The cable car brings fearful excitement and heart-pounding thrill as it glides over the sea at a height of 86m. But the fear is short-lived! You will soon find yourself in awe at the vast sea under your feet.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Cloud Trails</p>How about strolling over Songdo sea that has turned even bluer along with the refreshing autumn wind? You can do so on Sky Walk Cloud Trails that connect the mainland and Geobukseom Island east of Songdo Beach. As you walk along the wooden deck trail with its smooth curves, you will be able to enjoy various sculptures that embody different scenes of Songdo. For a moment, you may feel sentimental while watching the transparent waves rocking back and forth from under your feet. \n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Songdo Beach</p>By the day’s end, the sun sets and city lights start to turn on one by one. This is when Songdo Beach falls into a state of ecstasy. The darker the sky and the sea become, the more colorful and bright the lights of Cloud Trails and Busan Air Cruise glow to fill up the night sky. The sunset here is a harmony of the sea, island, mountain and city. This may be the nightscape that you can only find in “Songdo,” the romantic travel spot of Busan. \n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "The modern era from the Korean Empire days to the Japanese occupation period holds the painful history of our people. Ironically, though, various structures built during that era as well as their history, culture and time provide us with fresh perspectives. If we were to define modern structures in a phrase, it would be the great traces left by the times. There are many of such modern structures still remaining in Busan. Let's time travel together with the modern structures you can meet in the city. \n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Dong-gu, Busan: Busanjin Ilsin Girls’ School (Busanjin Church), Former Baekje Hospital</p>Designated as Busan Metropolitan City Monument No. 55, Busanjin Ilsin Girls’ School is a modern building constructed by an Australian missionary in 1905. It is one of the better preserved modern structures that still maintain its original shape despite the passage of 100 years. Built with the beauty of proportionality and balance, Busanjin Ilsin Girls’ School now serves as a memorial hall that exhibits materials on modern Christianity and female students who received new education in the modern era.\nAcross from Busanjin Ilsin Girls’ School stands Busanjin Church, also built by an Australian missionary in 1891. The first demonstration movement in the Busan area was started in 1919 by the students of Busanjin Ilsin Girls’ School and Christians of Busanjin Church. We hope that you think about the preciousness of our daily lives in this place where you can feel and remember the joy of independence. \nThe former Baekje Hospital, the first-ever modern private general hospital built in 1922, was a rare four-story modern structure in the days when most buildings were either single-story or two-story at most. Its antique arch entrance grabs people's attention. The former Baekje Hospital building has a long history of changes from a general hospital and a Chinese restaurant to a dormitory for military officers and, also, the Busan Public Safety Headquarters after the Liberation. \nThe former Baekje Hospital, the first-ever modern private general hospital built in 1922, was a rare four-story modern structure in the days when most buildings were either single-story or two-story at most.

Originally, it was the Busan Branch of Hansung Bank but, after overcoming several changes and crises for potential demolition, it has become a complex cultural space that still retains it old appearance. Having reinforced its structure and carried out remodeling, it is a modern structure in which the past and the present coexist. It shows the typical Japanese architectural style featuring a hipped roof, granite string courses and red bricks. \nAs you climb up Bokbyeongsan Mountain in Jung-gu, Busan, you will find a building that stands at the tallest point of the mountain. This modern structure that resembles Hansung 1918 is the Busan Meteorological Observatory. Built in 1934, its pear shape, which symbolizes Busan, and forsythia-colored bricks are impressive. Because it has never been used as anything other than a weather-observing station, it was selected as one of the Centennial Observing Stations by the World Meteorological Organization. \nThe main feature of the observatory is its windows. These vertical, hinged windows do not open sideways but, rather, upward. The view of downtown Busan seen through the large windows is another element to definitely check out. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Seo-gu, Busan: Provisional Capital Memorial Hall, Seokdang Museum</p>Provisional Capital Memorial Hall, which is a two-story house, was initially built in 1926 as the official residence of the governor of Gyeongsangnam-do, and is also where the first Korean president, Rhee Syngman, temporarily stayed during the Korean War when Busan was the nation's provisional capital. It is surrounded by a petite garden and boasts a quiet and cozy vibe. \nAfter going through full-scale remodeling in 2012, it reopened as a new exhibit hall featuring two ground floors and one underground floor. The Provisional Capital Memorial Hall exhibits a variety of materials that display the lives of refugees during the war, the period of the provisional capital, Busan's politics, economy and culture. \nThe red brick building that notably stands out amongst modern structures is Seokdang Museum, which is an affiliate museum of Dong-a University. Designated as Busan Metropolitan City Registered Cultural Heritage No. 41, the museum was constructed during the Japanese occupation era and used as the Busan Provisional Government Office during the Korean War. \nIt has a unique gable roof that seems as if books are piled on top of it and, overall, the building exudes a dignified impression. The museum holds a countless number of national treasures and valuable properties including the \"autograph of late An Jung-geun.” Be reminded of Busan in the modern era while looking at and walking through the modern structures that still tell the stories of political and social changes of Korean modern history. \n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "From the Hollywood blockbuster “Black Panther” loved by movie fans all around the world and the Korean film “Old Boy” that attracted over 10 million people, to the drama, “The King : Eternal Monarch,” the travel show, “Salty Tour” and, even, the Netflix original, “My Name” that has recently gained much popularity, Busan has been the background for countless movies and dramas. A trip to exotic scenes that have appeared in films is an opportunity to encounter the true charm of the city. We have prepared five different themed travel courses that are more cinematic than an actual movie. Be the main character of a film and explore Busan. \n\n\nWatch the video <a href=\"https://youtu.be/R-U6-EIvKbs\" target=\"_blank\" alt=\"새창열림\" class=\"link-style1\">https://youtu.be/R-U6-EIvKbs</a>\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Move, Mile in Movie</p>Driving in Busan more cinematic than a movie\n\nIt is rare to find a city where the mountain, sea and river form such splendid harmony. A city where the South Sea and the East Sea meet, the Nakdonggang River flows and Geumjeongsan Mountain stands tall, Busan possesses the gift of nature. Here are four driving courses on which you can cross mountains, seas and rivers and feel and relive the touching moments from movies on a wide screen outside the car window. \nThe “riverside drive” course from Gimhae Airport to Dadaepo Beach offers the beautiful landscape of the Nakdonggang River that has not been stained and damaged by development. The “bridge drive” from Dadaepo to several bridges including Namhangdaegyo, Busanhangdaegyo and Gwangandaegyo is known for the thrill of driving over the sea and the gorgeous scenery of Busan viewed on the waters. The “coastal drive” from Haeundae Marine City to Imnang Beach along the coastal roads of Songjeong and Gijang contains the essence of the Busan sea. The “forest drive” taking you through Jangansa Temple and Ahopsan Forest is like a vitamin that provides you with energy and healing away from the bustle of a large city. \n\nWhichever course you choose, these four courses are connected to one another allowing you to continue driving in any direction of your choosing. Simply jumping in a car and touring the seas, mountains and rivers that Busan has to offer will allow you to feel the charms of the city with all your senses. \n\n<div class=\"type1\"><div class=\"headWrap\"><p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Riverside Drive</p></div><ul class=\"course1\"><li><span>Gimhae Airport</span></li><li><span>Nakdonggang Estuary Embankment</span></li><li><span>Jangnim Port</span></li><li><span>Dadaepo Beach(The King : Eternal Monarch, 2020 / My Name, 2021) </span></li></ul></div>\n<div class=\"type1\"><div class=\"headWrap\"><p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Bridge Drive</p></div><ul class=\"course1\"><li><span>Namhangdaegyo Bridge</span></li><li><span>Busanhangdaegyo Bridge(The Spy Gone North, 2018 / My Name, 2021)</span></li><li><span>Gwangandaegyo Bridge(DP, 2021 / Black Panther, 2018)</span></li></ul></div>\n<div class=\"type1\"><div class=\"headWrap\"><p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Costal Drive</p></div><ul class=\"course1\"><li><span>Marine City(Hard Hit, 2021 / The King : Eternal Monarch, 2020)</span></li><li><span> Haeundae Beach(Cinema Street, 2021)</span></li><li><span> Dalmajigil Road(Hard Hit, 2021/ Burning, 2018) </span></li><li><span> Songjeong Beach(Will You Be There?, 2016 / Okay!

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "From the Hollywood blockbuster “Black Panther” loved by movie fans all around the world and the Korean film “Old Boy” that attracted over 10 million people, to the drama, “The King: Eternal Monarch,” the travel show, “Salty Tour” and, even, the Netflix original, “My Name” that has recently gained much popularity, Busan has been the background for countless movies and dramas. A trip to exotic scenes that have appeared in films is an opportunity to encounter the true charm of the city. We have prepared five different themed travel courses that are more cinematic than an actual movie. Be the main character of a film and explore Busan.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Our History</p>Time travel for Busan’s stories\n\nDuring the Korean War, Busan was forced to serve the role as the provisional capital. A city that embraced refugees who were pushed all the way down to the southern edge of the country to flee from the war, Busan acquired a mixture of countless stories, pains, joys and sorrows and came to have a historical heritage that no other city has. A trip in search of the stories held inside Busan is, in other words, a trip to find the city’s identity. From Gamcheon Culture Village where refugees lived in shanties and the Provisional Capital Memorial Hall once used as the residence of the provisional government’s president to the 40 Stairs and 168 Stairs showing the exhausted lives of the people of Busan during the post-war industrialization period and Kangkangee Arts Village, which was the cradle of the Korean shipbuilding industry, let’s dive into the hidden stories of Busan that cannot be fully told even if we stay up all night. \n\n\n<div class=\"type1\"><div class=\"headWrap\"><p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Time travel for Busan’s stories</p></div><ul class=\"course1\"><li><span>Gamcheon Culture Village(L.U.C.A.: The Beginning, 2021 / A Little Princess, 2019)</span></li><li><span>Provisional Capital Memorial Hall</span></li><li><span>Gukje Market(Ode to My Father, 2014)</span></li><li><span>Kangkangee Arts Village(My Name, 2021) </span></li><li><span>Huinnyeoul Culture Village(Waiting For Rain, 2021 / The Attorney, 2013)</span></li><li><span>40-step Culture & Tourism Theme Street(The King : Eternal Monarch, 2020)</span></li><li><span>168 Stairs</span></li><li><span>UN Memorial Cemetery</span></li><li><span> Uam-dong Urban Forest(A Little Princess, 2019)</span></li></ul></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Gamcheon Culture Village</p>Place that still holds the residential culture of Busan from the Korean War days when refugees built houses even atop mountains.

This unique modern structure combines Western and Japanese styles. It was used as the residence of the President of the Korean Provisional Government during the Korean War, and, today, is home to the Provisional Capital Memorial Hall. The building has great value as a site of Korean modern history and as a place that holds the stories of Busan. \n\nLocation\n45, Imsisudoginyeom-ro, Seo-gu, Busan / Provisional Capital Memorial Hall Parking Lot\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Gukje Market</p>Gukje Market was once filled with novel, amazing goods imported from overseas. One of the most notable traditional markets in Busan, it still overflows with things to eat, see and enjoy on various streets including Gourmand Alley, Patbingsu Alley, Cosmetics Alley and Antique Alley. The traces of time encountered in the narrow alleyways clearly show the history of the market. \n\nLocation\nSinchang-dong, Jung-gu, Busan / Gukjesijang-ro Section 1 Public Parking Lot\n\n<p class=\"font-size24 colorDarkBlue medium\"><img style=\"width:20px\" src=\"https://visitbusan.net/upload_data/board_data/BBS_0000014/163754563058176.png\" alt=\"카메라아이콘\"> Works filmed </p><p class=\"font-size25 colorDarkBlue medium\">Ode to My Father(2014) <span style=\"font-size: 18px;color: #000;\">Starring Hwang Jung-min and Kim Yunjin</span></p>A movie of humanism depicting the stories of a father and mother who sacrificed all their lives for their family during the impoverished and difficult days of refuge\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Kangkangee Arts Village</p>The Daepyeong-dong area in Yeongdo-gu, which is the cradle of Korean modern shipbuilding, is still home to many ship-repair factories. The sounds of striking hammers “kangkang” on the surfaces of ships and the removal of rust resonate throughout the area. As desolate streets of the town meet with art, the area has been transformed into a tourist attraction that cannot be found anywhere else other than Busan. \n\nLocation\n36, Daepyeongbuk-ro, Yeongdo-gu, Busan\n\n<p class=\"font-size24 colorDarkBlue medium\"><img style=\"width:20px\" src=\"https://visitbusan.net/upload_data/board_data/BBS_0000014/163754563058176.png\" alt=\"카메라아이콘\"> Works filmed </p><p class=\"font-size25 colorDarkBlue medium\">My Name(2021) <span style=\"font-size: 18px;color: #000;\">Starring Han So-hee, Park Hee-soon and Ahn Bo-hyun</span></p>A drama depicting a revenge-driven girl who becomes a member of a criminal organization to find the killer who murdered her father\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Huinnyeoul Culture Village</p>Colorful houses gather together along the coastal cliffs.

Having the look of Busan in the olden days including wooden telephone poles and railroad tracks, it’s as if we have traveled back in time on a time machine.\n\nLocation\nJungang-dong, Jung-gu, Busan / Yuchang Building Public Parking Lot\n\n<p class=\"font-size24 colorDarkBlue medium\"><img style=\"width:20px\" src=\"https://visitbusan.net/upload_data/board_data/BBS_0000014/163754563058176.png\" alt=\"카메라아이콘\"> Works filmed </p><p class=\"font-size25 colorDarkBlue medium\">The King : Eternal Monarch(2020) <span style=\"font-size: 18px;color: #000;\">Starring Lee Min-ho and Kim Go-eun</span></p>A drama depicting love transcending between two different dimensions between the emperor of the Korean Empire and a Korean detective\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">168 Stairs</p>The pain and sorrows of refugees are vividly told through stories by grandmothers and grandfathers who had to ceaselessly walk up and down the 168 steep stairs.

Divided into the cemetery and green areas, it feels sacred and solemn but, at the same time, peaceful and heartwarming. \n\nLocation\n93, UN Pyeonghwa-ro, Nam-gu, Busan / UN Memorial Cemetery Parking Lot\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Uam-dong Urban Forest</p>Known as the \"La La Land\" of Busan, it boasts an excellent view. Container ships anchored at the port are seemingly in harmony with Yeongdo and Busanhangdaegyo Bridge that cuts across the sea to present a fantastic nightscape.

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "A November day in Busan when red fallen leaves, the blue sea and green nature coexist\nShall we go on a trip to find the blue, red and green colors hidden throughout Busan to meet the various colors presented by nature?\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Hoedong Reservoir</p>Hoedong Reservoir is an artificial reservoir built for citizens having suffered from drought in the past. Located in Oryun-dong and Hoedong-dong of Geumjeong-gu, it boasts a storage capacity of 18.5 million tons. This reservoir was responsible for the source of Busan’s water supply. Being designated as a water source conservation area in 1964, it was restricted from public access until 2010. Lacking the footsteps of visitors to the reservoir for nearly 50 years, it naturally became a place where beautiful ecosystems and nature that have not been polluted by humans can be encountered.\nHoedong Reservoir, created by nature and people, has become a famous healing travel destination in Busan as a place where you can enjoy a pleasant walk along the “lake.” The backdrop of the reservoir changes its clothes of various colors with every passing season, creating a different landscape every time. Especially when autumn arrives, it is widely loved as a travel course where people enjoy watching red-tinged maple leaves.\nSince Hoedong Reservoir sits on both Oryun-dong and Hoedong-dong, there are several ways to access the area, which makes it an ideal place to travel during this season. In particular, if you walk barefoot on Ttangmoesan Red Clay Forest Trail, you feel healthier with each step and you can also enjoy the excitement of seeing the scenery that changes every hour. You can move on foot through the entire reservoir area so it is possible to not only enjoy its appearance, which can be seen differently with each angle, but also experience the path that changes from a red clay road and deck to a forest.\nIf you want to feel the excitement of walking and seeing the red autumn leaves together, why don’t you take a trip to Hoedong Reservoir right now? You can record and capture beautiful memories while enjoying nature in a relaxing manner from morning to late afternoon. You will be reminded of how valuable your health is as you walk around Hoedong Reservoir and engrave the gorgeous images of nature in your heart. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Oryukdo Island</p>Do you know the mysterious island, Oryukdo, that seems to be five islands to some people and six islands to others? Oryukdo is a beautiful island located in Yongho-dong, Nam-gu, Busan and designated as Scenic Site No. 24. The island is named Oryukdo because it looks like there are five or six islands depending on the tidal difference or viewing angle, and, thanks to the Skywalk, it is one of the most beloved travel destinations.\nSunrise Park, located in front of Oryukdo, is a place where you can walk on top of the coastal cliffs viewed from Oryuk and is also the beginning of the “Haeparang Trail.” You can begin your walk from Oryukdo and make your way to Igidae Coastal Trail and then along the East Coast. In addition, Sunrise Park has a well-established deck road so, if you walk up along this path, you can get a closer look at the scenery of Oryukdo Island. The landscape surrounding Oryukdo that you can look out at while walking along the deck road shows phenomenally cool scenery and the unique colors of the blue sea. If you wish to check out the color of the blue sea that you may have only read about in fairy tales, take a closer look on “Oryukdo Skywalk.”\nOryukdo Skywalk built with iron beams installed on a 35m high coastal cliff was opened on October 18, 2013. Oryukdo Skywalk is a glass bridge with 24 glass plates constituting the floor through which you can vividly and transparently enjoy the blue sea and coastal cliffs under your feet. If you walk along the dizzying Skywalk, you can get a more up close view of Oryukdo Island and, as you follow the U-shaped road, you can see the cliff under Sunrise Park in greater detail. You can also capture the vivid images of blue waves crashing into the coastal cliffs.\n“Oryukdo Island” is a destination where you can enjoy not only coastal cliffs, the Skywalk, trails and parks with the blue sea in the background but also the green nature of Busan. In Oryukdo, diverse species of flowers bloom every season and the color of the sea changes constantly depending on the weather, so it is a travel spot where you can always capture joyful memories regardless of the season you visit. How about taking a trip to Oryukdo Island to check out the blue sea with your own eyes?\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Busan Citizens Park</p >Busan Citizens Park, located in Busanjin-gu, is a famous “green” travel spot of Busan where you can fully appreciate the green appearance throughout the four seasons. 1.1 million trees, Bujeoncheon Stream and Jeonpocheon Stream are located in the park, which is in the form that is closest to nature. In particular, Hialeah Lawn Plaza, located in the center of the park, is a large space six times the size of a soccer field and provides a rest area for many citizens. That is why more and more people come to enjoy Busan Citizens Park in various ways, such as picnicking and taking strolls, all year long from spring and summer to autumn and winter.\nBusan Citizens Park aims to be a park that has no barriers and obstacles and is designed to allow men and women of all ages to enjoy the park to the fullest by establishing level entrances without any curbs, obstacle-free deck roads and information signs. It is also a travel destination that guarantees the safety of visitors by operating CCTVs, security centers and safety guard centers, aiming to maintain a safe space 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\nBusan Citizens Park, where you can see various flowers and trees, is designed to be a place where your experience does not end with simply walking and touring the surroundings but, instead, enables you to enjoy contemplation and bring home precious memories from pavilions, lakes, and maze gardens. Thanks to the features of the park, it is known as a great place to travel for a day, and is gaining a lot of attention on social media as a beautiful natural park with hashtags like #BusanPicnicAttraction, #BusanHealingAttraction, and #BTS_Busan.\nIt is also nice to take a break on the trail while walking in the park or spending time looking out at the lake with a clear mind. Why don’t you enjoy some valuable time for yourself at Busan Citizens Park where you can have a perfect picnic just with a lunch box?\n\n\n"

Just as all the other places with the suffix “-ridan-gil,” Mangmidan-gil is full of exotic cafes, pubs and restaurants. However, Mangmidan-gil is quite different from any other “-ridan-gil.” One by one as small galleries have nestled together, Mangmidan-gil has become a new culture and arts district! Let’s enjoy an elegant cultural life in the exotic galleries of Mangmidan-gil. \n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Walking House New York</p>Walking House New York boasts exotic red bricks that make you feel as if you are on Soho Street in New York. Walking House New York is a culture and arts agency composed of culturally knowledgeable artists who pursue liberated lives, which may explain how, here, you can not only encounter various cultures across borders but also check out spatial production that stimulates your curiosity. \nDecorated with “Olive Green,” this space is the signature cultural space of “Walking House New York,” known as “Dream Traveler’s Wanderer Fantasy”! Unique posters on the walls, books filling the bookshelves and densely attached magnets are all personal collections of CEO Lee Sang-hoon who runs the travel agency, “Dream Expedition,\" specializing in art travel. It would be nice to dream of a new journey here where someone’s experiences and traces are on clear, honest display.\n*Exhibition period: November 9, 2021 - January 28, 2022\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">OBJECTHOOD Gallery</p>After leaving Walking House New York and walking a bit alongside the Suyeonggang River, you will find a tranquil garden that makes you feel as if you are in a luxury mansion in Europe. This is the art gallery, “OBJECTHOOD.” On a late afternoon, the objects harmonize with the sunlight that warmly penetrates through all the glass windows to create heartwarming senses. At OBJECTHOOD, you can enjoy the works of rising artists both from Korea and overseas, and you can also purchase artworks at the select shop set up inside the gallery. \nCurrently, a special exhibition titled “BREATHE IN” is being held at OBJECTHOOD. It tells the stories of objects built by the warmth of more than 20 craftsmen, writers and designers including “White Porcelain Polygonal Moon Jar,” which has reinterpreted the lines of moon jars in a modern way. If you wish to receive warm comfort and consolation from beautiful objects, make sure to visit OBJECTHOOD. \n*Exhibition period: November 11 - December 30, 2021\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Kukje Gallery</p>Not far from OBJECTHOOD lies “Kukje Gallery” where you can enjoy the works of world-famous contemporary artists. Kukje Gallery is located inside “F1963,” a cultural complex remodeled from the former Kiswire Suyeong factory. “F1963” is regarded as one of the greatest architectural attractions in Busan! Thanks to the renovation of a huge factory once equipped with equipment lines, you can enjoy artworks with an open view without any obstacles. \n“Your Faces,” the first photography exhibition by film master and director Park Chan-wook, is currently being held at F1963 Kukje Gallery. The photos taken with Director Park Chan-wook’s unique perspective create a strange and bizarre vibe and makes you look back on the daily scenery that you have been nonchalantly passing by. \n*Exhibition period: October 1 - December 19, 2021\n\nMany people believe that it is difficult to appreciate artworks but we recommend the Mangmidan-gil Gallery Tour where they can encounter art up close. This winter, it would be nice to revitalize your daily life and circulate your mind while enjoying various works of art. \n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "A seemingly higher sky and chilly wind somewhere between fall and winter where another season goes by. On a day like this, you cannot help but want to go on a walk. There’s no better place than Eulsukdo Island in late autumn to enjoy the season passing by. From the cool river breeze blowing from afar to the golden reed fields and vast green plains, every element of Eulsukdo makes you feel submerged in the sentiments of late autumn. Let’s take a trip to Eulsukdo where autumn quietly passing us by can be enjoyed. \n\nWatch the video of Eulsukdo, a safe travel destination in Busan,\ntraveled by Seoul Walker <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0RTP7bSMRw\" target=\"_blank\" alt=\"새창열림\" class=\"link-style1\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0RTP7bSMRw</a>\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Eulsukdo Eco Park</p>Eulsukdo is an island created by the Nakdonggang River and the sea. \nOnce a “repository of ecosystem” in which various living organisms live in coexistence thanks to its unique topography and, also, the largest “habitat for migratory birds” in Asia, Eulsukdo is becoming a “center of culture and arts” as a variety of cultural facilities have been introduced in the area in recent years. With the ecosystem and modern culture forming harmony, Eulsukdo presents novel scenes and looks at every step you take from the cool river breeze and graceful fields of reeds to vastly spread green plains and people spending their own leisure time, all of which coexist like a beautifully sounding orchestra. Isn’t this the reason we visit Eulsukdo in late autumn? \n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Chohwawon Garden and Picnic Plaza</p>There is only one reason people visit Eulsukdo Island during this season. It is because of the soft and fine-haired, cotton candy-like Pink muhly grass! Chohwawon Garden situated inside Eulsukdo Eco Park has colonies of Pink muhly and cosmos, which enable you to fully enjoy the season of fall even if you do not travel afar. Next to Chohwawon Garden, there is also the Picnic Plaza on a vastly spread green plain. How joyful it would be to sit on a mat and enjoy a relaxing time with a delicious lunch box under the blue sky?\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Eulsukdo Trail</p>If you wish to take a quiet stroll, walk on Eulsukdo Trail along the river on the outskirts of the island. Continuing along the Nakdonggang River, the trail is a great place to space out while looking at green grass with the cool river breeze on your face. Eulsukdo Island also provides free bicycle rentals, which makes it a perfect place for a bike date. Rent a bike and enjoy the ride to your heart’s desire while piercing through the river breeze. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Museum of Contemporary Art Busan</p>The Museum of Contemporary Art Busan, constructed by the city of Busan in the middle of Eulsukdo, opened in June 2018. The exterior of the museum is unique to suit the vibe of the island, which is the “repository of ecosystem.” The museum building itself is an artwork titled the “Vertical Garden,” and the green plants growing on the walls of the museum grab the attention of visitors. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Eulsukdo Migratory Bird Park</p>In addition to wetlands of different sizes, there is a stroll path near Nakdonggang Estuary Eco Center that is perfect for walking. As you walk along the path for a while, you will reach the Eulsukdo Migratory Bird Park before you even realize. Around this time of the year, migratory birds that have returned to the wetlands and the golden waves of the reed fields culminate in awesome beauty, allowing you to take an elegant autumn stroll. Eulsukdo Migratory Bird Park, a place that offers healing just from walking slowly.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Traveling in search of attractive places has received a great deal of attention these days. The destination is even better if it is not just a pretty space but also a place where you can feel the local culture and sentiments at the same time. Let me introduce regenerated cultural spaces that have turned old and outdated alleys into fresh, sparkling venues. Let’s go and visit the regenerated cultural spaces of Busan that will make you feel “hip” just by being there!\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Mangmi-dong B-ConGround</p>A space that was once dark and gloomy under an overpass, barely used as a parking lot for locals, has been transformed dramatically after encountering culture, shopping and entertainment venues. Isn’t the expression “usefulness of space” something that we should attach to a place like this?\n\nAs you can see from the combination of “B” from “Busan” and “CON” from “containers,” B-ConGround is made of 180 containers, the idea of which stemmed from how containers symbolize the port city of Busan.\n\nA colorful procession of containers spans some 800m in an empty space under the city highway that crosses downtown Busan. You cannot help but stop walking to look at the scene of containers shaped like Lego blocks filling the empty space under the overpass. You would want to find “hip” places like playing with a picture puzzle and enjoy taking pictures all day long.\nOnce you enter a crowd of containers out of curiosity, a surprising world starts to unfold, including art galleries where you can enjoy artworks or that hold various cultural experience events in addition to a shopping ground with many different cafes, restaurants and shops, and a playground, which is an outdoor space to play. Across from Mangmi Intersection, you will find a community space used as a meeting place for residents, and a family deck used as a creative space for disabled artists.\n\nAs the empty space under the overpass, which once seemed useless to be used for anything, has been reborn as a cultural complex, the atmosphere of the village also changed. From a long-standing auto repair shop and an old public bath house near the playground to Japanese-style restaurants and a local bookstore, it is evident that this will soon become a place to which many Instagrammers will make a pilgrimage.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Haeundae Daelim Mansion</p>To the passersby who have no clue as to what lies inside, it seems like a typical apartment unit. This single apartment building, located on Haeundae Beach where five-star hotels and luxurious imported car showrooms are situated, and its wooden door plate on a reddish brown-colored tile exterior make you come to the realization of the long history of the building. The building’s name is “Daelim Mansion.” No one is interested in an old and worn-out “mansion” but people with smartphones in their hands continue to flock to a space that even tourists would just pass by.\n\nWithout any signs or indications, “Daelim Mansion is hot these days thanks to cool shops that are hidden in some of the spaces in the apartment where residents still reside. It is fun to visit these shops as if you were hunting for treasures while moving up and down the corridors and stairs where the old vibes still remain. It feels like going to a friend's house during our childhood years. The imagination for placing commercial spaces in between residential houses is simply amazing. It is even more attractive because it is a space that only people who know about this hidden gem can visit.\n“NONFICTION,” a body cosmetic brand that has stood out for its efforts to visualize scents, opened two showrooms here. One of the showrooms is being managed by an employee but the other is operated unmanned. Once you pass through an old hallway and enter the showroom, a completely different world unfolds as if you have teleported to a different time and space. The interior was decorated with such a sensuous and sophisticated atmosphere that you will not believe it if someone told you that it is still inhabited by actual residents. The corner area with a mint-colored chair in front of a large whole glass window is particularly attractive. It is the perfect Instagram spot that is popular these days.\n\nIn addition, the pop-up store of the women's clothing brand “eunoia” and other local designer's brands as well as “Tart Hooligan” are also established on each floor of the apartment building. Although they are all located inside a building of the same shape, these stores exude completely different vibes. Comparing the interior designs that express different personalities of the shops is another fun thing to do at Daelim Mansion. This is a place that shows the trend of commercial spaces these days, providing experiences and increasing empathy instead of merely selling goods to people.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Yeongdo AREA6</p>Yeongdo, where Korea’s first modern dockyard was built, flourished as people and money flocked to the region but eventually began to go downhill with the decline of the shipbuilding industry. As the center of Busan moved from Nampo-dong to Haeundae, the decline of Yeongdo accelerated further. Samjin Amook played a significant role in the re-rise of Yeongdo, which was remembered as the outskirts of Busan for a while. Samjin Amook, which has been making fish cakes in Busan since 1953, started to attract tourists by building a fish cake experience center and history museum, and Yeongdo took the center stage once again.\n\nSamjin Amook has launched another project for the revival of Yeongdo. This project is “AREA6,” a cultural complex that opened right next to the main branch of Samjin Amook. The term “AREA” is a combination of “A” from ARTISAN, which means a master craftsman; “RE” from reproduction; and “A” from AVENUE, which means an alley. “6” refers to not only the six houses, which had existed there before this building was built, but also 6 PM when merchants of the neighboring Bongnae Market close down their stores for the day. It is the number showing determination that the building will continue to be lit up even after 6 PM to attract people. As its name suggests, AREA6 is a conceptual space where brands, products and master craftsmen who have been in the region for a long time seek and promote local revitalization as they work late into the night.\nThe first store you see at the entrance of the first floor is Songwol Towel. It is one of the most notable companies in Busan that sells high-quality towels and bath products. Various items to remember the trip to Busan, including mini towels made with symbols of Busan, will grab your attention. The Busan-style premium dried fish brand, “Ineo Ajimae,\" a local traditional liquor curation space “Busan Judang,\" “Columnist,” which sells creators’ art posters, and the lifestyle brand, “CHI PROJECT,\" which reinterprets traditional Korean culture and crafts in a modern way, are also catching people’s eyes.\n\nLocated on the second floor is a gallery and the leather fabric brand “WSL.” “WSL” is operated in the form of a cafe where you can experience various leather products and, also, drink beverages. If you go up to the third floor following the stairs, a rooftop awaits you. A cool chair lies upon where the warm sunlight falls down. It is a perfect place to take a break while enjoying the surrounding scenery.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "A lot has changed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As more and more companies are implementing the work-from-home system because of the pandemic, a new lifestyle has been born. “Work-ation,” a term coined by combining “Work” and “Vacation,” means working and taking a vacation at the same time at a travel destination. \n\nWork passionately and rest relaxedly! Work-ation adds energy to life and increases work efficiency! Where should we spend our Work-ation to be able to tell people that we did it right? I will introduce three hotels in Busan that are perfect for Work-ation. \n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">“Lavalse Hotel,” the hot place of Yeongdo</p>The Lavalse Hotel is a venue you probably have been to at least once if you happen to be a social butterfly! It is located right in front of Yeongdodaegyo Bridge so you get a view of not only Yeongdodaegyo but also Busandaegyo Bridge. From the sea full of bright sunlight and the subdued sea colored with the sunset to the sea filled with beautiful lights, Lavalse offers different vibes that change with every hour and a great working environment for everyone from early birds to night owls. The neat and modern interior free of unnecessary objects enhances the concentration of work. \nIf you feel hungry after work, try the restaurant located on the third floor. You can enjoy healthy premium course meals at Alianon, a restaurant that offers La Chinata Gourmet, which is a Mediterranean and Spanish olive brand. In addition, Sky Cafe & Bar on the 28th floor is excellent for selfies so make sure to stop by. The cafe, decorated with luxurious ornaments and sophisticated furniture, features whole glass windows, which enable you to enjoy freshly baked bread and various dishes while looking out to the sea of Yeongdo. Here, you can enjoy not only a wonderful view but also handmade desserts full of sincerity.\nThe Lavalse Hotel has a small but fully equipped sauna, which is perfect for relaxing your fatigued body. There is also a coin laundry that is essential for Work-ation travelers. The Lavalse Hotel has a variety of packages for Work-ation travelers including a Rest Package, Lavalse Yogini Package and Starry Night Sky Package, all of which aim for your solid, well-filled rest. \n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">“AG405” embracing the vast Gwangalli Beach</p>The name, AG405, means “Amazing Grace” and “Another Gate” (another space of healing)! The rooms where you can clearly enjoy the vast Gwangalli are decorated with elegant and sophisticated interiors, providing relaxation and romance. If the weather is on your side, you can enjoy the mystical purple sunset of Gwangalli, which is art in itself! Wouldn’t it be an unforgettable moment? Suites, ondol suites, luxury rooms and deluxe rooms offer their unique charms and suit the purpose of your travel and business. \nAG405 filled with places of healing everywhere has a “Color Showroom” that adds sensibility to relaxation. The Color Showroom of eight colors from the 3rd to 10th floors is decorated with sensuous and stylish interiors that anyone from Generation MZ would love to take pictures. When you enter this place, you feel as if you are being healed even on the inside with the comfort presented by the different colors. \nIf you have finished your work for the day, take a tour around the hotel. The lobby on the first floor where various artworks are on display gives the impression of being in an art gallery. If you want to relax while watching the panoramic Gwangandaegyo Bridge, go to the cafe on the second floor. You can feel a different type of sentiment with a cup of aromatic coffee. If you want to see the sparkling sea, the sky lounge on the 10th floor is the place to be. Let’s enjoy a unique pleasure while enjoying sincerely prepared foods in a chic atmosphere. \n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">“Baymond Hotel” with an incredible view of Haeundae</p>Rooms are in harmony with the subtle yellow wallpaper, comfortable green furniture and wooden furniture! As soon as you enter this place, it makes you feel as if your work efficiency will increase significantly. With Haeundae being just around the corner, you can see its shining ripples in a single view. If you’re tired from working at your desk, you can take a break using the sea as a dessert.\nAfter the work day comes to an end, throw a bath bomb in the bathtub and enjoy bathing. A bath to complete the day! Wouldn’t work stress and fatigue accumulated throughout the day disappear as soon as you soak yourself in a fragrant bathtub? It seems like a waste of time to just stay in the room. \n\nIf you want a more expansive view, head to the rooftop swimming pool. While looking at the backdrop of Haeundae harmonized with skyscrapers, it makes you feel as if you are a character in a movie in New York. The most delicious food in the world is food prepared by someone else! It feels like your work speed will accelerate if you start your day well with breakfast made of fresh ingredients every day! At the Baymond Hotel, a space of healing within the city, let’s realize the Work-ation that we have all been dreaming of. \n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "In 1407, the Joseon government established Busanpo Japan House to curb the plundering of villages on the South Coast by Japanese raiders and, in 1426, opened Busanpo Port to increase trade with Japan. However, in the aftermath of the Korea-Japan Treaty of 1876, Busanpo was forced to be opened by the Japanese and became a window through which invaders advanced to mainland China and transported goods they had stolen. In the area of Jwacheon-dong, which neighbors Busanpo, there still remain the traces of Busan’s history, people and life including the Anti-Japan independence movement in the occupation era, the Korean War and the industrialization period. From the outer fortress of Busanjinseong to Jeonggongdan Altar, Ilsin Girls’ School and Busanpo Opening Cultural Center, Busanpo Gaehanggado Road that connects these historic places is a living history textbook.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Historic Story Alley</p>As you step into a narrow alley from Jwacheon-dong Furniture Street, a fancy mural grabs your attention. This is the Historic Story Alley of Busanpo Gaehanggado Road. The murals in this alley depict various stories related to Korean and Japanese history from the Japanese invasion of Joseon in 1592 to the Anti-Japan independence movement.\n\nThe most remarkable element of the alley is the enormous Korean flag painted on a number of buildings. The shape of Taegeukgi changes according to your viewing angle and, if you happen to be in the right location, you will see the entire alley covered in Taegeukgi.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Jeonggongdan Altar</p>When you step out of the Historic Story Alley, you will come across Jeonggongdan Altar. Jeonggongdan is an altar erected by Busan Cheomsa Yi Gwang-guk in 1766 as a tribute to Captain Jeong Bal who died in the Siege of Busanjin, the first battle of the Japanese invasion of 1592, and the residents of Busanjinseong Fortress who followed their captain. The annual ritual service is held on April 14 in the lunar calendar.\n\nA tile-roofed building standing tall in the middle of a residential district is so fascinating that those passing by who do not know about the building try to figure out what it is. Once you climb up some very steep stairs and go through a gate, an expansive front yard greets you. The village and church seen behind the yard feel strange but interesting at the same time. It is amazing to be able to feel the Japanese invasion of 1592 that you only read about from textbooks so vividly in real life in the middle of the city.\nOn a stone wall path on the right side of Jeonggongdan, yellow ginkgo trees are letting go of their last leaves. This elegant and peaceful stone wall path, which is a rare attraction in Busan, is a great place for Instagrammers to take awesome pictures.\n\nThe memorial stone standing on one side of the street is in memory of Pastor MacKenzie. Originally from Scotland, Pastor MacKenzie came to Busan in 1910 and carried out mission work for 29 years. Although his full name is James Nobble Mackenzie, he also went by his Korean-style name, Maegyeonsi. In addition to being the founder of Ilsin Christian Hospital that still actively treats and cares for patients in Jwacheon-dong, he also established a nursing home for lepers and spent many years treating and looking after them.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Busanjin Ilsin Girls' School</p>Once you go past Jeonggongdan Altar and walk further up the alley, a modern building made of red bricks appears. It exudes an exotic impression as if you have suddenly teleported to a different country. Built by an Australian missionary who had come to Korea after the opening of Busan Port in 1895, it was the first institution in Busan and the Gyeongnam region that educated modern women.(Busan Metropolitan City Monument No. 55)\n\nThe building was reconstructed as a modern structure in 1905, and its front staircase and handrails on the second floor still preserve the original appearance of the 20th-century Western-style building. Notably, the building possesses great architectural value as it was built by Western missionaries in the pre-Japanese occupation period. An excellent mix of proportions and balance makes you feel as if you are looking at a work of art.\n\n\n\nIlsin Girls’ School holds significance in the history of the anti-Japan movement that cannot be overlooked. On March 11, 1919, teachers and students of Ilsin Girls’ School held the first-ever March 1st Independence Movement in Busan and the Gyeongnam region, and a countless number of students followed the cause and showed resistance against the Japanese while waving the Taegeukgi. And it is no coincidence that the district of Dong-gu produced so many independence fighters including Park Jae-hyeok, who threw a bomb at Busan Police Chief Hashimoto, and Jeong Oh-yeon who died at a young age for his involvement in the Incident of Dongnae Middle School Joseon Youth Independence Party.\n\nThe street leading from Ilsin Girls’ School to Geumseong High School is a space that pays tribute to such independence fighters. The Declaration of Korean Independence, written and recited by 33 ethnic representatives, is engraved on a wall in its original form. There is also a memorial wall as a reminder of the spirit of patriotism and independence of the 29 independence fighters from Dong-gu.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">General An Yong Bok Memorial Busanpo Opening Cultural Center</p>If you go past Geumseong High School and walk up a little more, you will find General An Yong Bok Memorial Busanpo Opening Cultural Center. An Yong-bok was an ordinary fisherman born in Jwacheon-dong, Dong-gu who once served in the navy. He was fluent in Japanese as he frequently visited Japan House. He also seized Japanese fishing boats that encroached upon Ulleungdo and Dokdo and submitted formal complaints to the feudal government of Japan. He later even received an official diplomatic letter from Japan confirming that the two islands of Ulleungdo and Dokdo indeed belong to Joseon. It is still difficult to fathom how an individual was able to achieve such great feats while traveling back and forth between Joseon and Japan. We can only guess from the many records he left but it is hard even to simply imagine such accomplishments.\n\nDisplayed in the front yard of the cultural center is a replica of the boat An Yong-bok used to cross the Straits of Korea. Once you step into the center, you can view the entire process of An’s two trips to Japan. The origin story of the name, Busan, and materials related to the opening of Busanpo are also on display.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Jeungsan Park Observatory</p>On the other side of General An Yong Bok Memorial Busanpo Opening Cultural Center, you will see an elevator installed that goes up to Jeungsan Park. But it is no ordinary elevator that we normally see; it is an inclined elevator that climbs up a slope like a cable car. While it is rare in Korea, it is the type of elevator that you often run into in mountainous countries like Switzerland.\n\nAfter you press a button like you would with a typical elevator, it soon arrives and opens its door. The inside is also no different from that of a common elevator. The biggest difference is that you can look out at the scenery through the glass as the elevator climbs up a slope on a rail. To get to Jeungsan Park, you need to transfer to another elevator. As the altitude rises, you will be able to see not only Busanpo Gaehanggado Road that you have just walked along but also Busan Port and the sea of Busan in the distance.\n\n\n\nOnce you step out of the second elevator, you will find a sign that reads, \"Jeungsan Japanese Fortress.\" Jeungsan Japanese Fortress is a fortress built by the Japanese army during their invasion in 1592. After toppling Busanjinseong Fortress, Japanese invaders constructed a fortress at this very location as an advanced base for their assault on Joseon.\n\nThe walls of the fortress still remain today so you can picture and imagine the appearance of Japanese fortress. Jeungsan Park is established at the site of Jeungsan Japanese Fortress. It features sports facilities and stroll paths for locals. Once you walk up the fortress wall stairs, you will reach a broad playing field and a three-story observatory on one side. At the top of the observatory, you get a panoramic view of Jwacheon-dong, Bukhang Port and Busanjinseong all below your feet.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "It would be difficult to find someone in Korea who has not heard of Gwangalli. It is one of the two most famous tourist attractions of Busan along with Haeundae. Gwangandaegyo Bridge that crosses the sea is a landmark of the city attracting a great deal of attention both in Korea and abroad.\n\nWe have prepared ways to travel and enjoy Gwangalli properly. There are many people these days who travel alone because of COVID-19, right? A trip to Gwangalli by myself! Let’s take the trip together to discover the hidden stories!\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Space Just For Myself - Hotel 1</p>If this is a trip by myself, I can’t help but be that much more picky in selecting my accommodations. It has to be a safe and pleasant environment and it would be great if the place is well-equipped with convenience facilities and be reasonably priced. It would be the icing on the cake to have the view of the sea from my window. Hotel 1 is a capsule hotel located on Gwangalli Beach that sufficiently satisfies all of the above difficult-to-meet conditions.\n\nAs you open the snow white curtains and enter your room, the blue sea unfolding outside the huge windows immediately grabs your attention. Though being a capsule hotel, its ocean view rooms enable you to enjoy an atmosphere that is comparable to that of five-star hotels from the bed. You can choose a room among various sizes from single-person rooms to 4-person family rooms, all of which provide natural latex mattresses and pillows. The public shower rooms, restrooms and laundry rooms are also very clean.\nIf you take the elevator and go up to the highest floor of the building, you will find a rooftop space called “Byul Kai.” The space is decorated in a cute and charming fashion with the view of the expansive Gwangalli sea in the backdrop. From rocking chairs like those we find in vacation spots to a large jacuzzi and a wooden cabin, it is filled with photo spots that will amaze and excite Instagrammers.\n\nThe highlight of this rooftop space is the “stairway to heaven.” With every step on these dizzy but thrilling stairs, a whole new scene unfolds before your eyes. A photo taken with the orange sunset in the background will be the selfie of your life.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Food By Myself - Donggyeong Bapsang</p>Epicurism is an element that cannot be left out for any trip. If you are looking for a nice meal even by yourself, try Donggyeong Bapsang hidden along Gwangalli Beach. The front gate and front yard, which make you feel as if you are in a refined restaurant in Japan, raise the level of your anticipation from the beginning.\n\nOnce you enter the restaurant, you will see the chef gently fanning and diligently grilling eels. The original flavor of eels you taste at “Jubako,” an eel cuisine restaurant in Tokyo, Japan that has been grilling freshwater eels for 230 years now, has been imported to Korea. The word, Jubako, actually refers to the stackable side-dish box used to maintain the temperature of grilled eels. At Donggyeong Bapsang, you will also find grilled freshwater eels served in such square-shaped boxes.\n\nOne of its most popular grilled freshwater eel dishes, “Unaju,” places a whole eel on top of white rice. The strange smell inherent in eels is eliminated and, instead, a subtle but soft taste is presented. Typically, the sauce spread on eels is too salty or sweet that it makes you feel like you’ve had enough just after a few pieces but Unaju does not lose its clean, delicious taste even with the last piece. The side dishes and hot soybean soup served together are also amazing.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Walk By Myself</p>After finishing your meal, it’s time to enjoy a walk by yourself. Samick Beach Apartments located at the end of Gwangalli Beach is the starting point. As you walk along the well-organized coastal path and look out at the sea, the enormous Gwangandaegyo Bridge feels like it is right in front of you. And the skyscrapers of Haeundae Marine City in the background remind you of a city in a foreign country.\n\nWhen you go down to the beach, there are a number of photo spots including a red sculpture, which consists of Hangul consonants and vowels of the word “Gwangalli”; a swing that looks like a white ring; and reed parasols that exude an exotic vibe. The area is full of attractive places that will make your day go by quite quickly if you just spend time taking pictures.\nAs you go past Gwangalli Beach and continue to walk along the coastal path, you will see a small port where fishing boats are gathered together. This is Millakhang Port where fishermen still come to fish. Unlike typical fishing villages that are quiet and peaceful, Millakhang Port is surrounded by high-rise buildings. At the end of the seawall that encompasses the port, red and white lighthouses stand next to each other to welcome the fishing boats returning to the port.\n\nIf you follow the path established along the seawall, you will be able to reach the lighthouses. Gwangandaegyo and the reddish sunset seen behind the lighthouses form a beautiful painting. It is a unique scene of Gwangalli that cannot be seen from the beach.\nOnce you leave Millakhang Port and walk a bit more along the beach, you will find Millak Fresh Fish Center where many raw fish restaurants greet customers. The beach right in front of the fish center is Millak Waterside Park established for citizens to relax while watching the sea.\n\nThe floors and stairs painted in the primary colors of red, blue and yellow grab your attention. When you climb up to the observation deck built in the shape of a boat, Gwangandaegyo appears literally right in front of your eyes. At night, it becomes a popular spot to see the nightscape from which the splendid view of Marine City can be seen along with Gwangandaegyo. In the summertime, many young people purchase raw fish from the fish center, spread the food out on the beach and enjoy great food and the romance of a summer night.\n\nThe riverside path established along the Suyeonggang River is pleasant from Millak Waterside Park to Suyeonggyo Bridge. As you walk and enjoy the fancy scenery of downtown Busan including Marine City, Suyeong Bay Yachting Center and Centum City, you will reach Suyeonggyo before you even realize. When you stand on the bridge that connects Millak-dong and Centum City, you will get a panoramic view of the area from Busan Cinema, the home of the Busan International Film Festival, and the world’s largest Shinsegae Department Store to Marine City, Millak-dong and Gwangandaegyo. The blissful sunset and the fancy nightscape are both the highlights of a Busan trip that cannot be missed.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "There’s no way we are going to leave our dogs at home when we go on a family trip. For at least one day out of the entire trip, it would be nice to have time just for our dogs while traveling in Busan. Therefore, we have prepared three wonderful pet cafes in Busan that would be great for you to take your dogs. Let’s take a trip to unique places where our furry friends can run around and relieve stress while the family can also have a relaxing time!\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">D’with</p>Located near Busan Central Bus Terminal in Nopo-dong, D’with exudes a relaxing atmosphere starting from the entrance. Tall trees lined up in the yard can be seen over wooden fences, and props such as tables, camping chairs and lunch boxes are placed in different corners, making you feel as if you are at a camping site.\n\nThe true character of D’with comes alive in the evening when lights installed in the yard light up one by one. When large light bulbs set up on a row of trees emit yellow lights, the romantic atmosphere reaches its peak. I wonder if there is any better spot than here to take selfies with your dogs.\nWhat is also beautiful is the space offered by the cafe where you can unleash your dogs in the yard and enjoy warm drinks with your family. Heartwarming and peaceful sentiment permeates throughout the building as if you are visiting a cabin deep in a forest somewhere. This is a place where you can spend a quiet and relaxing time even by yourself without having to bring a pet. The popular bakery bakes and serves freshly baked bread. Spo1 Park is located right in front of the cafe so you can enjoy more activities with your dogs.\n\nD’with is open year round. It should be noted that on the 2nd and 4th Tuesdays of every month, only space rentals are available. If there are no pre-booked space rentals on any of these days, then the cafe stays closed. Parking is available in the exclusive parking lot right in front of the cafe. The hours of operation are from 11 AM to 10 PM. 0507-1455-0520\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Healing Pet</p>The hottest area for those traveling to Busan these days is Gijang. Thanks to the many cool cafes established one after another along the beautiful East Sea, it has been a while since Gijang became a must-visit locale for cafe tours. Healing Pet, located not too far from Imnang Beach, is as good as it gets as a healing cafe for your dogs.\n\nIn addition to a large grass playground, it also has a private swimming pool in the summer. On the edge of the playground, chairs, tables and parasols are set up for families to relax while their dogs run around. The cafe also features awesome photo spots where you can take pretty pictures of your puppies.\nAnother advantage of Healing Pet is its bath facility. The facility is well equipped with bathtubs and dry rooms to wash and dry your puppies so you can let your dogs run around the playground as much as they want and return home after taking a clean bath. But you have to bring your own shampoo, towels and combs.\n\nThe cafe space where families can relax while dogs are having fun running around is roomy and comfortable. You can order basic drinks as well as simple foods such as corn dogs, tteokbokki and mandu. What is also popular is the self-ramen making machines with which you can cook your own ramen. Healing Pet is open year round from 11 AM to 9 PM every day. Parking is available in the exclusive parking lot across the street from the cafe. 051-727-8256\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Daeng Daeng World</p>Daeng Daeng World, located at the entrance of Igidae Park, is a pet cafe with an attractive large swimming pool. The pool is in the middle of the yard and, in the wintertime, it switches to a play facility for dogs. There are maze-like paths set up for dogs to have fun and also fun rides in different corners.\n\nThere is a broad grass playground next to the swimming pool. The playground is quite spacious so it is more than enough for dogs to run around. The cafe also features play facilities for dogs on one side of the playground such as hurdles, jumping stands and tunnels. A separate space is provided for larger dogs to prevent any conflicts or confrontations.\nWarm sunlight constantly comes into the cafe to make the space feel cozy. When you go up the stairs, you can step out to the observatory on the second floor. Here, you can enjoy the view of not only the playground but also the surrounding scenery. Gorgeous photo spots are installed throughout the cafe so it is a great place for you to enjoy taking pictures with your dogs.\n\nDaeng Daeng World is open year round. However, the facility may closed unexpectedly due to inclement weather, etc. so it is advised to check in advance before you visit. Daeng Daeng World is open from 12 PM to 6 PM on weekdays and from 11 AM to 9 PM on weekends and holidays. Parking is available in the exclusive parking lot right in front of the cafe and also at the nearby Igidae Public Parking Lot. 0507-1385-0227\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Although winter is not over yet with the cold wind touching your face, the weather is getting warmer and warmer towards spring. In Busan, plum blossoms are in full bloom, spreading the sweet scent of spring all over the place. We are here to introduce you to three plum blossom spots beloved by Busan residents. Shall we go on a spring journey to these places?\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\" >Suyeong Historical Park</p> The first plum blossom destination to check out in Busan is Suyeong Historical Park. Suyeong used to be where the Headquarters of Gyeongsangjwado Naval Force Commander was located during the Joseon period. Suyeong was its shorted form which this area was named after. Suyeong Historical Park was built on the site where the Headquarters of Gyeongsangjwado Naval Force Commander was located. The Headquarters of Gyeongsangjwado Naval Force Commander oversaw the four military camps along the southern coast. Given that, this place is full of historical sites such as South Gate of Suyeongseong Fortress, Altar to Twenty-five Heroes enshrined with the ancient tablets for 25 fallen heroes, and Shrine to General An Yongbok, a guardian of Dokdo Island during the Joseon period. Neighboring Suyeong History Museum that protects and preserves intangible cultural properties such as Suyeong Yaryu (Mask Dance Drama of Suyeong), it has become the best-known historical park in Busan.\n\nOnce you pass the outdoor theater space in Suyeong History Museum and reach the Shrine to General An Yongbok, a few plum blossom trees will come into sight. They will start to bear flower buds in mid-February which will come into full bloom between late February and early March. The spirit of plum blossoms, which have managed to survive a freezing winter, goes perfectly well with the atmosphere of Suyeong Historical Park. Although you may still want to button up your overcoat, you can wait for spring ahead of time by enjoying the plum blossoms in full bloom.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Chungnyeolsa Shrine</p>Located in Allak-dong, Dongnae-gu, Chungnyeolsa Shrine has the ancestral tablets of patriotic martyrs who sacrificed themselves during the Japanese Invasions of Korea in 1592. Despite its heavy atmosphere, it is also known as the best flower viewing spot throughout the year, often visited not only by local residents but also by tourists across the country. Since spring is just around the corner, it is now crowded with people wishing to see plum blossoms in full bloom.\n\nIf you walk a few more steps after passing the entrance, you will see beautiful plum blossoms in full bloom on your left. The trees are so tall and thick that plum blossoms growing out of their branches are just like a heap of white snow. You may start enjoying the fresh scent of flowers. The scent will guide you to beautiful red prumusmume in full bloom in one corner. Cornelian cherry flowers around it are an indicator that spring has come\n\nIt takes only 30 minutes to look around Chungnyelsa Shrine. Since it is not too crowded in most cases, you can enjoy a taste of spring in a laid-back environment, which is even better. You may lose track of time, having fun finding beautiful flowers such as camelia, magnolia, and cornelian cherry flowers hidden in every corner of the shrine.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">UN Memorial Cemetery</p>Did you know that the world’s one and only UN memorial cemetery is located in Busan? Yes, we are talking about UN Memorial Cemetery located in Daeyeon-dong, Nam-gu. It is a memorial for UN peacekeepers who sacrificed themselves during the Korean War. At this time of the year, this cemetery becomes a famous plum blossom viewing spot often visited by tourists across the country.\n\nAmong numerous plum blossom spots in Busan, UN Memorial Cemetery is particularly popular because it is home to beautiful red prumusmume in one corner. Red prumusmume is known not only for its beautiful pink petals but also for its captivating scent. You cannot help but noticing the existence of red prumusmume from a distance.\n\nPlum blossoms at UN Memorial Cemetery are quick at bearing buds starting with early February as an indicator of spring. You must hurry yourself not to miss plum blossoms in full bloom. Since they come into bloom in the middle of winter, you may find them even more precious. If you want to enjoy a taste of spring faster than anyone else, UN Memorial Cemetery would be a perfect place to visit.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Now, we feel the gentle spring breeze touching our face. Here comes again the best time of the year to walk. Today, we will guide you to Busan’s bamboo forest trail in the gentle spring wind. Let’s head to this forest trail perfect for taking a walk alone or with your beloved ones such as friends, partner, or family members!\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\" >Hoedong Reservoir & Bamboo Forest Trail</p> Located across three local districts, Geumjeong-gu, Gijang-gun, and Yangsan-si, Hoedong Reservoir has been strictly preserved as a water resource protection area since 1964. Restricted public access allowed it to keep nature intact for many decades just as in the Korean Demilitarized Zone.\nIt was not until 2010 that this forbidden land was open to public after 45 years. After a 20-kilmeter-long walking trail was built around the lake, it immediately become one of Busan’s best places to take a walk. As you drink in the beautiful scenery that stimulates all your five senses along the paths in a dense cypress forest, the red clay trail where you can go barefoot, or the lakeside trail with reeds swaying in the breeze, you will never get bored.\n\nThe 5.9-kilometer-long Oryundae section that connects Hoedong Dam, Oryunbon-dong, and Sanghyeon Village is where you can find harmony between the lake and the forest, giving off unique vibes that are not common in Busan. As you pass through Oryunbong-dong, a bamboo forest will come into sight. A well-adorned trail will add more fun to your adventure. You can also enjoy listening to the sound of bamboo leaves rustling in the spring breeze as you walk along the trail above which bamboo trees form a canopy with the amazing effect of a tunnel.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\" >Ahopsan Forest, Gijang</p> If you are interested in a dense bamboo forest, Ahopsan Forest, Gijang would be a perfect choice. It was a private property not open to public until recently. The family who owned and managed the forest for the past 400 years recently opened its door to the world. It is possible to enjoy this amazingly well-preserved forest for it was a greenbelt land and a water resource protection area for a long time. The pinnacle of it is the bamboo forest.\nIn this incredibly dense forest too full of bamboos to let the sunlight, you cannot help but slow down. You will be overwhelmed by the tranquility in the deep forest and certainly, you are not the only one fascinated by this mysterious bamboo forest. Ahopsan Forest, Gijang has become one of the most visited tourist attractions in Korea since it is a famous filming location for numerous films and TV series such as Kundo: Age of the Rampant, The Tiger: An Old Hunter’s Tale, Memories of the Sword, and The King: Eternal Monarch.\n\nAhopsan Forest has two incredibly large bamboo habitats. The second bamboo forest has a walking trail, allowing you to approach bamboo trees for a better look. If you are lucky enough to be left alone in this forest, you will feel as if you were in a zero-gravity environment.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\" >F1963 Maengjongjuk Forest</p> Unlike Hoedong Reservoir and Ahopsan Forest located in the suburbs of Busan, F1963 Maengjongjuk Forest is a bamboo forest at the city center. A small forest was built by planting Maengjongjuk stalks (phyllostachys pubescens) on a piece of land where KISWIRE’s wire factory used to be. Although it is small in size, Maengjongjuk stalks formed a dense forest which enables you to feel as if you were deep in the woods.\nThe bamboo forest trail contains old pieces of discolored concrete which are from the floor of the wire factory. At first, you may find the trail unfit for the overall atmosphere of the forest; however, once you are done taking a walk, you will realize you just had an amazing experience along this extraordinary forest trail. It is also worth noting that taller bamboo trees are once intertwined with older bamboo trees.\n\nBamboo releases a large amount of oxygen, which keeps the forest cooler than its surrounding areas. Thanks to this, you can always stay cool and refreshed in the bamboo forest. As you walk along the bamboo forest trail with the gentle spring breeze touching your face, you will be able to shake off all your travel fatigue as well.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "And so, spring is here once again. The temperatures have risen to the point that plum blossoms, the heralds of spring, are blooming en masse. Rather than flocking to spring flowers like everyone else, why not take this time to head to the quiet alleyways of Busan? Today, we invite you to the Millak-dong Cafe Street, which is quite close to the Gwangalli Beach.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\" >Cafe Sightseeing in Alleyways</p>From Gwangalli Beach, go past the Millak-dong Raw Fish Street to find the apartment complex to the right-hand side, and the alleyways leading into the residential districts to the left-hand side. Gwangalli Beach is one of the most recognizable tourist sites in Busan, but old residential districts such as these still remain near the beach. Millions of visitors visit the beach every year, but not many know that these alleyways, often hidden from their view, hide the interesting stories.\n\nAny visit to Millak-dong's alleyways must include the quirky cafes hidden throughout the neighborhood. More than 10 cafes have moved into this otherwise quiet residential district, creating an interesting clash between the hip cafes with old alleyways. \n\n\"Casual Book Shop\", whose retro-chic sensibilities are apparent from its apricot-tiled exterior, is a comfortable cafe furnished with wood tones that go exceedingly well with the calm alley outside. The view of avid readers reading their book under the drowsy afternoon sun, a cup of coffee in hand, invites one into the comfortable interior regardless of one's love for books. \"Cafe Voisin\" stands next to the old Okcheontang Public Bath, its sharp roof and window walls recognizable from afar. Its signboard cheekily proclaims \"we serve coffee\" on a signboard with the familiar pictogram of heat rising from a bath. \"Schwarzwald\" is a cafe that was furnished from one of the many single-story houses in the neighborhood. Trees with sharp silhouettes and the design choices hearken back to its namesake in Central Europe.\n One more block ahead is the \"Cafe Imanti\", a cafe known for its chic interior and delectable dessert; \"rad. Coffee Stand\", whose exposed concrete interior design treads on the fine edge of modern sensibilities; \"LOWNGRIN\", a pretty cafe with a warm atmosphere brought by the harmony between white and wood tones; and \"iNNYGO Espresso Bar\", offering espresso against the backdrop of a grey-green tone interior. \nDon't miss the other treasures of Millak-dong, like \"Yoikuma\", which took the area by storm with its mouthwatering bowl of tendon (tempura rice bowl) with seasonal ingredients, and \"Meerock Super\", a virtuoso serving creative Korean dishes made with seasonal ingredients. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\" >Falling in color</p>Color is often the first thing that one notices when walking in Millak-dong. Whether they were always there or were repainted recently is unclear. What is clear is that these sensual colors are in no way a mainstay of Korean houses. Indeed, the atmosphere veers toward the Equator, perhaps a city in the Indian subcontinent, perhaps in Latin America. Finding these explosive colors in the most random places is yet another fun to be had in alleyways of Millak-dong.\n\nOne house is decked in bright yellow, another in the recently-popular mint. Green, blue, pink, and orange mix together in a celebration of colors. Who could have imagined that one would see such a colorful scenery in an alleyway in Busan? It feels as if the place is just below the radar for Instagrammers, only to blow up through word-of-mouth in near future.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\" >A trip down the retro memory lane</p>Some alleyways seem to lead to a bygone time. Fans of the TV show Reply 1988 will immediately recognize the two-story houses like those in the show, while others will see the transition in the retro stores that call back to the 80s and the 90s.Faded signboards testify to the days gone by in small laundromats, public baths feel like they stepped out from one's childhood visits with one's parents, and one seems to hear the laughter of the children in the twilight-drenched alleys. It feels as if the entire neighborhood was a one big filming site for a retro coming-of-age film.\n\nIs that fence only about chest-high? The low fence gives one a full view of the plum blossoms, camellia, and spring flowers. I stop in my tracks and pick up my camera once again. Even though the sound of children's laughter seemed to only come from my memories, I nevertheless could not help but feel a pang of nostalgia. From food to dessert, leisurely walks, and photography spots, could Millak-dong as a tourist site be as hot as Gwangalli Beach?\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Now that spring is in full swing, one merely needs to open a window to feel the fresh breeze and the scent of the flowers. It is now the time to enjoy the joy of spring with one's entire body, and what else to do but to take a romantic drive through Gijang, a place where the green nature and the blue sea stand out dazzlingly like watercolor paintings. \n\n\n<div class=\"type1\"><div class=\"headWrap\"><p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Recommended itinerary</p></div><ul class=\"course1\"><li><span>Cheolma Baegyang Farm</span></li><li><span>Imnang Beach</span></li><li><span>Sinpyeong Small Park</span></li><li><span>Jukseong Catholic Church (Filming Set of TV Drama Dream)</span></li><li><span>Lotte Cinema Drive Osiria</span></li></ul></div>\n\n<p class=\"font-size25 colorDarkBlue medium\" >Cheolma Baegyang Farm</p>The first stop in our drive through Gijang in spring is Baegyang Farm, a place to feel the verdant energy of Gijang's nature. Its location near the peak of Baegunsan Mountain, 522m above sea level, affords the farm access to clear mountain air.\nBaegyang Farm itself is made up of a wide grass field and carefully sculpted trees. The entrance fee is only KRW 3,000, a steal considering the relaxing walks one could take or the fact that one can pitch a tent and have a camping-like experience throughout the day.\n\nThe grass field still retains signs of the previous winter, but as summer approaches it takes on its characteristic bright green hue. It is a perfect place for a picnic, so make sure to pack a mat or even a tent. If you get lucky, you can even pitch your spot in the shade of a tree and enjoy the blue sky without being blinded by the sun. Cooking is not allowed in the premises, so make sure to prepare food in advance.\n\nThe scent of the spring permeates throughout the Baegyang Farm. Flowers begin to bloom between the austere bamboo trees. Explore the place and find your very own heralds of spring. Baegyang Farm is highly recommended for those who want a day camping or picnic.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size25 colorDarkBlue medium\" >Imnang Beach</p>One can reach Imnang Beach from Baegyang Farm in about 25 minutes by car. This dainty beach offers its visitors a more intimate access to the East Sea.\nDrivers have a front-row seat to the view of the sea as they drive along the golden sand beach. There's a public parking lot near the beach, so one can even park the car and take a walk on the sand beach.\n\nWaveon Coffee, located only 3 minutes by car from the beach, is a cafe that enjoys nationwide fame. Its architectural beauty and the remarkable view of the sea offers a perfect backdrop for your cup of coffee.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size25 colorDarkBlue medium\" >Sinpyeong Small Park</p>Continue your drive southward along the coastal road to find Sinpyeong Small Park, a great place to take a breather from the drive. Despite its small size, it is a great place to capture the beauty of Gijang sea.\nAs one of the sites that mark the Haeparang and Galmaetgil Trails, Sinpyeong Small Park is home to a quirky observatory: a dynamic picture of a ship that is poised to set sail against the rough currents.\n\nFollow the wooden decked road to the area below the observatory for a quick walk by the sea. The beach below is made up of small pebbles and unique rock formations.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size25 colorDarkBlue medium\" >Jukseong Catholic Church (Filming Set of TV Drama Dream)</p>This Catholic church, whose exotic appearance contrasts strikingly with the emerald sea, is the former filming set for the TV show Dream. In the 13 years since the end of the show, the church has established itself as a popular tourist destination of its own right.\nBut Jukseong Catholic Church is not the only thing worthy of visit here: don't miss the rugged rock formations that surround the church building, and the well-maintained and trimmed walking trail in contrast. Above all, don't miss the view of Jukseong Catholic Church's red roof!\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size25 colorDarkBlue medium\" >Lotte Cinema Drive Osiria</p>This new drive-in theater in Gijang's Osiria Tourist Complex has a massive screen that allows one to experience the theater-going experience in one's car.\nThe romantic atmosphere of a drive-in theater after sunset is certainly a great way to end your trip in Gijang. The charm of a drive-in theater is, of course, the fact that you can enjoy all the benefits of a movie theater in the comfort of your car.\n\nIf you prepare the snacks beforehand, it can be a comfortable picnic as well.\n\n\n** Notice\nLotte Cinema Drive Osiria is currently temporarily closed due to the relocation of the theater.(A separate notice will be provided when the theater resumes.)\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Now that the spring breeze is in the air, you can see spring flowers everywhere in Busan. Some of these places, in particular, have beautiful views that can only be found during this season, so dust off your camera and take the pictures of the day in Busan.\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\" >Oryukdo Sunrise Park</p>Sometimes, healing is as simple as watching the view of the glittering sea, the yellow daffodils and mustard flowers, and Oryukdo Islets beyond from the Oryukdo Sunrise Park. The starting point of the Haeparang Trail Course 1 is connected to Igidae Waterside Park, another famous scenic spot, with a wooden decked road.\n\nFollow the trail to the hill to find a golden field of daffodils and mustard flowers. Just pick a spot that overlooks the sea, and you’ll have the centerpiece of your spring album.\nOryukdo Sunrise Park’s unique charm is certainly the fact that you can enjoy the sea and the spring flowers at the same time. The silhouette of the Oryukdo Islets on the sea rounds out one of the most celebrated and popular sceneries in Busan in springtime.\n\nWith each step upward on the wooden decked road, you can meet the mustard flowers and cherry blossoms above. This trail also leads to Igidae Waterside Park.\nNeed to take a breather? Step into the nearby cafes, where you can enjoy the colorful view of the area with your cup of coffee. Some cafes have rooftop seats, from which you can have an expansive view of the surrounding areas.\n\nOryukdo Skywalk is an integral part of any visit to the Oryukdo Sunrise Park. This observation platform delights thrill-seekers with a chance to walk above the sea on a reinforced glass floor. If you’ve had a fill of peace and healing with the daffodils and mustard flowers on the hill, give yourself a jolt of life with the thrilling view of the Skywalk!\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorable medium\" >Daejeo Eco Park</p>Fancy a walk through a yellow field? Head to Daejeo Eco Park! This riverside park has a massive field of mustard flowers next to the Nakdonggang River. There are trails that take you into the fields, and what better way to enjoy the golden waves of mustard flowers under the spring sun than being in that wave of gold?\nThe opening of the mustard flowerbed in Daejeo Eco Park this year is particularly meaningful to the people of Busan because the park had been closed to the public for the past three years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps because of that, a huge number of visitors is expected to visit here this spring. Of course, the sheer size of the field ensures that you won’t be crowded out of your frame. Mustard flowers here begin to bloom in early April and reach full bloom in mid-April, so April is indeed the best time to enjoy the view here.\n\nThis is unsurprisingly a great place to take a picture for your spring trip in Busan. \nBut gold is not the only color in Daejeo Eco Park in spring; the park also sees a splash of pink from the cherry blossoms. After all, this is the starting point of the “Nakdonggangbyeon Samsimni Cherry Blossom Road,” a 12 km-long road of cherry trees that stretch along the Nakdonggang River. Mustard flowers on one side, the “cherry blossom tunnel” on the other; this is truly a place to enjoy the serenity of the spring.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\" >Hwamyeong Eco Park</p>Nakdonggang River is home to a number of different ecological parks. One such ecological park rivals the springtime view at Daejeo Eco Park: That’s the Hwamyeong Eco Park, Busan’s most beloved sanctuary for tulip flowers. It is home to thousands of colorful tulip flowers, from pink to red, white, yellow, and purple. \nTulip flowers that boast their vivid colors must be the best backdrop for the pretty picture of the day. Tulips bloom until May at Hwamyeong Eco Park, so take that into account for your photography trip. The unique charm of tulip flowers is certainly a worthy, flamboyant addition to your spring album.\nHwamyeong Eco Park’s size also means that the park also accommodates pure-white cherry blossoms in addition to tulip fields. Just place a mat below the shade of the cherry tree, and you have a great place for a springtime picnic. Feast on your lunchbox and take a walk along the Daecheoncheon Stream to get the most out of your picnic.\n\n\n"

The bus drives through the Gwangandaegyo Bridge, and brings the passengers to the breathtaking view of the sea.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Haeundae Beach – Moontan Road</p>Haeundae Beach tops the must-visit lists in Busan. Why not check it out yourself? Alongside the Blue Line bus ride to Moontan Road (Dalmajigil Road/Beach Train), one has the option of walking along the beach.\n\nMoontan Road in spring is full of beautiful cherry blossoms, and the view of the cherry blossoms with tall green pine trees in this place is one of the symbolic views of springtime nature in Busan. You can always remember Moontan Road as one of the best cherry blossom spots in Busan!\nIf you're in Haeundae, you can't pass up the offer to take the Beach Train. The view from the train's expansive windows keeps one captivated until one reaches Cheongsapo Village and Songjeong.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">ASEAN Culture House</p>ASEAN Culture House is a cultural space that hosts exhibitions and lectures dedicated to the cultural diversity of ASEAN states.

If you are interested, make sure to drop by!\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Songjeong Beach</p>Songjeong Beach, the enduring haven of surfers in Busan, is also a part of the Blue Line course. Knock on the door of the nearby surfing school if you want to try riding the waves. Another option is to walk along the beach from Jukdo Park to Gudeokpo Port.\nThe next stop in the tour is Gijang. Here, one follows the road from the OSIRIA Station to Haedong Yonggungsa Temple, Ananti Cove (Hilton Busan), Jukdo Island (Yeonhwa-ri), and returns to OSIRIA Station. One also passes by the recently-opened Lotte World Adventure Busan.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Haedong Yonggungsa Temple & Maritime & Fisheries Science Museum</p>Haedong Yonggungsa Temple, a Buddhist temple overlooking the sea on a coastal cliff, was closed to the visitors during the pandemic. Now, however, the temple is ready to welcome the visitors once more. \nSome say that Haedong Yonggungsa Temple is one of the most beautiful Buddhist temples in Korea, and it's not hard to see why. Indeed, it is a must-visit destination for any visitor to Busan. \n\n\n\nWhen one walks along the Galmaetgil Trail next to the temple, one is brought to the Maritime & Fisheries Science Museum.\nLocated at the shores of Gijang, Maritime & Fisheries Science Museum is the first science museum in Korea for maritime and fisheries sciences. It is a place where children of all ages can build their sense of curiosity and wonder, so if you are traveling with kids, this is a great place to make a stop at.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Ananti Cove (Hilton Busan) & Jukdo Island (Yeonhwa-ri)</p>Ananti Cove (Hilton Busan), a popular destination for a luxurious stay, is also included in the itinerary.

It is a good place to have some quality time with your children.\n\nOnce you've had a fun time in OSIRIA Theme Park, wind down with some shopping in the nearby Lotte Premium Outlets Dongbusan. This integrated shopping center combines supermarkets, shops, cinema, and other services on top of a premium outlet.

Convergence contents offered in the museum combine holograms, media facade, virtual reality (VR), immersive media, and other advanced technology with things for the children to learn and play with.\n\n\n\nSongjeong Station is the final stop in the Busan City Tour, before the bus returns to the Yonghoman Sightseeing Boat Terminal via the Gwangandaegyo Bridge. If one takes the 9th circuit, the last one offered for the day, one can end one's trip on a high note with the striking view of the sunset.\n\n\n"

If that is the case, why not take a City Tour Bus and enjoy the beautiful night view in Busan? We invite you to a nighttime tour that takes you across the Gwangandaegyo, Busanhangdaegyo, and other beautiful bridges in Busan for a true taste of night view in this wonderful city.\n\n<div class=\"type1\"><div class=\"headWrap\"><p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Busan City Tour Night View Tour (Bridge Tour)</p></div><ul class=\"Course\"><li><span>Busan Station (departure)</span></li><li><span>Busandaegyo Bridge</span></li><li><span>Busanhangdaegyo Bridge</span></li><li><span>Gwangalli Beach</span></li><li><span>Suyeong Bridge No 2</span></li><li><span>Marine City</span></li><li><span>Haeundae Beach</span></li><li><span>Busan Museum of Art & BEXCO </span></li><li><span>Gwangandaegyo Bridge</span></li><li><span>Busanhangdaegyo Bridge</span></li><li><span>Namhangdaegyo Bridge</span></li><li><span>Songdo Cloud Trail</span></li><li><span>Jagalchi & Gukje Market</span></li><li><span>Busan Station (arrival)</span></li></ul></div>\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Busan City Tour Night View Tour (Bridge Tour)</p>Busan City Tour Bus, which offers a comfortable ride on a bus to all the major tourist sites in Busan, has a very special ride that only takes place on Friday and Saturday evenings: It is the Night View Tour, which covers all the most highly regarded night view spots in Busan. Because the trip also takes one along all the major bridges in Busan, like the Gwangandaegyo, Busanhangdaegyo, Namhangdaegyo, and Busandaegyo Bridges, it is also known as the \"Bridge Tour\".\nBusan City Tour Bus Night View Tour starts at 19:30, in Busan Station plaza. If you want to have an even closer access to the view, make sure to take a spot on the 2nd floor of the bus, which is open to the air. The bus starts off with the sunset coloring the western sky red, takes one across the Busandaegyo Bridge to Yeongdo, and proceeds to the colorful Busanhangdaegyo Bridge.\n\nWhen the bus reaches Busanhangdaegyo Bridge, a massive suspension bridge that crosses the North Port, travelers finally see what being a port city means for Busan. The view there overlooks a pier where massive ships are moored at. Many ships, their lights burning as bright as day, carry the containers up and down. The light from the tower in Busanhangdaegyo Bridge illuminates the whole spectacle in a rather unreal light.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Into the charms of Gwangalli</p>Past the Busanhangdaegyo Bridge is Gwangandaegyo Bridge, one of the most recognizable symbols of Busan. The left-hand side of the bridge is dominated by the futuristic view of Haeundae Marine City and its skyscrapers. Once the bus reaches the Gwangalli Beach, the bus stops for 10 minutes for some quality photo-op time.\nEven though the sun has sunk beyond the horizon, traces of blue remain in the sky. The skyscrapers turn on their lights, and Gwangandaegyo Bridge showers the beach with its lighting. It is the best time to take a picture of the view. There's no need to move for a better view: one can simply take a picture of the bridge in front of the bus. The lighting can be insufficient, so make sure to compensate or hold your camera tightly!\nAt 20:00 and 22:00 every Saturday and Sunday evening, Gwangalli Beach hosts a drone show. Nearly 300 drones rise into the air and draw pictures on the night sky with brushes of light. They dance in tune in music, and create letters. People can't help but cry out in wonder with each movement of the drone. It has established itself as a new favorite among visitors to Gwangalli, so make sure to catch the show.\n\nAfter a brief stop, the City Tour Bus heads to Haeundae. After passing through Suyeong Bridge No 2, from which one has a wonderful view of the Centum City, one is brought to the view of the Marine City's skyscrapers, the Haeundae Beach, and Busan Exhibition and Convention Center (BEXCO), before the bus drives on the Gwangandaegyo Bridge. Up close, the main tower in Gwangandaegyo Bridge impresses with its sheer presence. It feels quite surreal to feel the sea breeze on top of the sea.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">City lights at Songdo</p>But the best of Busan City Tour is yet to come: A trip through the massive bridges of Busan, and a chance to see why this tour is also called the \"Bridge Tour\".\nAfter Gwangandaegyo Bridge, the bus heads right to the Busanhangdaegyo Bridge. At its peak, Busanhangdaegyo Bridge offers an expansive view of Busan's old city center, namely Yeongdo, Nampo-dong, and Choryang, along the shore. Smaller lights illuminate the Sanbok Road areas. So is the beauty of Busan from the sea.\n\nNext is the Namhangdaegyo Bridge. This bridge connects Yeongdo with Songdo. While it is not as extravagant as Gwangandaegyo or Busanhangdaegyo Bridges, the view from the bridge punches well above its weight. In particular, the romantic view of the lights on the sea in front of Yeongdo, generated by numerous ships, is said to be a must-see highlight of this tour.\nAfter passing through the three bridges, the bus arrives at Songdo Beach. Songdo Beach was the first public beach in Korea, and with the opening of the overwater cable car service, this historied beach established its presence among the people of Korea once again. If the City Tour Bus took us above the sea in wheels, the cable car service will fly us above the sea at night. The view from the sky is nothing short of fantastic, Songdo Beach, Yeongdo, and the sea glittering in a view that cannot be put to words. Another option is to take a walk along the Songdo Cloud Trail near the cable car stop. Its transparent floor offers a different sort of excitement at night.\n\nThe bus stops for a 10-minute photo break in Songdo. Once you've had your fill of photographs, the bus passes through the Nampo-dong area, home to Jagalchi and Gukje Markets, and returns to the starting point of the tour at Busan Station. The 2-hour 30-minute ride on the bus passes like a fantastical dream, just like the night view that unfolded before us in that trip.\n\n\n"

If you are planning to stay there, you can also enjoy an unparalleled access to the Blue Line.\nJukdo Island, which resembles a turtle floating on water, is the only island in Gijang. It is connected to the land via Yeonjukgyo Bridge, and many visitors go to the island to appreciate its green scenery.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">OSIRIA Theme Park (luge) & Lotte Premium Outlets Dongbusan</p>OSIRIA Theme Park is full of things to do, from the exhilarating luge ride to the newly-opened Lotte World Adventure Busan. It is a good place to have some quality time with your children.\n\nOnce you've had a fun time in OSIRIA Theme Park, wind down with some shopping in the nearby Lotte Premium Outlets Dongbusan. This integrated shopping center combines supermarkets, shops, cinema, and other services on top of a premium outlet. Its size ensures that your shopping experience will not be interrupted by large crowds.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Busan National Science Museum</p>Located near OSIRIA Station, Busan National Science Museum is an exhibition space that has something for the whole family. Convergence contents offered in the museum combine holograms, media facade, virtual reality (VR), immersive media, and other advanced technology with things for the children to learn and play with.\n\n\n\nSongjeong Station is the final stop in the Busan City Tour, before the bus returns to the Yonghoman Sightseeing Boat Terminal via the Gwangandaegyo Bridge. If one takes the 9th circuit, the last one offered for the day, one can end one's trip on a high note with the striking view of the sunset.\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "To commemorate the long-awaited summer, we've visited some places where we could meet the verdant beauty of nature. The weather has been a bit too erratic for our tastes, but one thing is for sure: We can't escape from the heat. If that is the case, why not make an effort to enjoy the view of summer in a healing place? Here are some of the places in Busan city center that one can meet the beauty of summer, hopefully away from the heat.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Walking with wildflowers in a cypress forest: Herb and Wildflowers</p>This botanical garden, located at the foot of the Geumjeongsan Mountain, is a place where you can rest in a beautiful forest or a nice cafe. It is a place to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Geumjeongsan Mountain, as well as the cypress forest, gardens, and wildflowers.\nHerb and Wildflowers was built over more than 30 years, each tree and flower planted and cared for with love. It is a place designed to be enjoyed slowly, so places to sit are located throughout the area.\n\nThe greenhouse is full of interesting plants, and the walking trail proves that even a short walk is enough to heal one's weary heart if it is garnished with lovely wildflowers.\nThe cypress forest and the wildflower trails both offer exquisite beauty that can only be enjoyed in summer. Don't miss the opportunity to sit in the shade of the tall cypress trees, and letting the cooling forest breeze wash over you.\n\nA cafe is slated to open in July, so if things get too hot, drop in and enjoy some cold beverage there.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Flowers and the Nakdonggang River, Gamjeon Wildflower Garden</p>Located near the Samnak Eco Park, Gamjeon Wildflower Garden is situated on the side of the Nakdonggang River where Dadaehang Road meets the Nakdongdaegyo Bridge. As the largest colony of wildflowers and aquatic plants in Busan, it is one of the best places to meet the wildflowers of Busan in summer.\nHere, one can meet the green fields and summer flowers just by taking a leisurely walk along the trail. Walking in the Gamjeon Wildflower Garden is a quiet and peaceful affair, punctuated by beautiful colors of wildflowers.\n\nThe walking trails, in fact, double as photo zones strategically placed between flowerbeds. Make sure to take a camera along, for some photo op with summer flowers.\nOnce you've had your fill of the wildflower garden, take the riverside road and stroll along the Nakdonggang River with the breeze. The unassuming river presents an intimate view of nature that, while not flashy nor extravagant, soothes one's heart.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">A green refuge within the city, Busan Citizens Park</p>Any discussion of places of refuge in Busan summer cannot leave out the blue skies, green nature, and the cooling sound of water in Busan Citizens Park.\nIn addition to expansive grass fields, the park is home to colorful flower beds and unknown wildflowers.\n\nAt the end of the pine forest trail lies the book cafe \"Forest.\" This cafe provides a cool refuge where you can read books in peace.\nJeonpocheon Stream flows next to the park, and its sand beach offers a trip to the beach without the crowds that come with popular beaches. The water fountains and beautiful lotus flowers are other sights that cannot be missed.\n\nThe grass field in the center of the park is a great place for a picnic. There are places around the park that rent out picnic sets, so you don't have to worry about getting up early to prepare your set.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "It sure is hot these days, right? It sure would be nice to have a place to go to in Busan, where you can enjoy the charms of the city without the heat, right? Well, your wish is granted: Let us take you to Bongnaesan Mountain in Yeongdo, the (metaphorically) hottest place in Busan right now. If you start at dusk, you can reach the summit after an hour's walk. Nighttime trekking in Bongnaesan Mountain is a great way to enjoy the sunset and the view of Busan at night. Come with us, and feel the breeze.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">1. From Mokjangwon to the summit</p>Located in the center of Yeongdo, Bongnaesan Mountain is a small mountain about 395m above sea level in height. But its summit offers a panoramic view of Busan in four directions, making it a popular tourist destination for everyone.\n\nOne has a choice of different routes to the summit. We chose the Mokjangwon Course, which dips into both the Bongnaesan Mountain Dulle-gil Trail and the mountain. A forest trail connects the parking lot in Mokjangwon with the Bongnaesan Mountain Dulle-gil Trail. The road is quite wide here, enough for a car to move through, leading to the cypress forest in the mountain.﻿\nJust a few minutes more, and one finds a small forest trail with clay-colored flooring to the right. Entering that trail brings one to a mineral spring, then the trail to the summit. From here, the trail is about 1km long in total. It can be completed in an hour, even with a leisurely pace. But make sure to take breaks and drink water in between, since some of the sections are made up of stone stairs that are rather steep. The forest at this hour is rather cool.\n\nFollowing the trail brings one to a flat space occupied by a pavilion. This is the Bongnaesan Yukgeori (central fork,) which divides into six separate trails. Following the road with wooden decks to the summit for about five minutes brings one to the first observatory.﻿\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">2. The first observatory</p>Push through the final hill to find an expansive wooden deck. This is the first of the two observatories set up at the summit of the Bongnaesan Mountain, and only by standing here can one find the scenery hidden behind the foliage: Songdo right below to Gamcheon, Dadaepo, and even Geojedo Island in the distance.\n\nThe sun illuminates the western skies in the color of gold before descending beyond the mountains. People begin to pull out their cameras to catch the sunset. The breeze cools one's brows and clears any sense of fatigue. Even the heat wave cannot compete with this freshness.﻿\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">3. Bongnaesan Mountain summit</p>Bongnaesan Mountain's summit is located only a minute's walk from the first observatory, at 395m above sea level. Samsin Halmae Rock, which is said to take care of the people of Yeongdo, is located near the signboard for the summit. The rock is treated with respect from the people of Yeongdo, who refrain from climbing or touching the rock. Instead, the people offer bows and prayers for the safety and well-being of the region.\nThe second observatory can be found right in front of the signboard. Here, one can get a truly panoramic view of the scenery in Busan. As the sun descends beyond the Cheonmasan Mountain, the world is awash in orange. On the opposite side, one can see the Busanhangdaegyo Bridge and Sinseondae Pier. Further away, one can see the Oryukdo Islets and Haeundae.\nAbout 30 minutes later, the lights begin to appear as the highlight of nighttime trekking in Bongnaesan Mountain. Busanhangdaegyo Bridge, lit up in many colors, join Gwangandaegyo Bridge and Haeundae LCT in dominating the view. The light of the pier and the loading docks feels otherworldly.\n\nOn the opposite side, the view of the Namhangdaegyo Bridge, which connects Yeongdo with Songdo, shines with Songdo Beach, Jagalchi Market, and the Yongdusan Park. The view of Hong Kong at night is said to be enchanting, but how's this for a view?﻿\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">4. Descent along the decked road</p>One finds that the area has become considerably dark after enjoying the view. Rather than re-tracing one's steps, it is safer and quicker to follow the decked roads, which are illuminated with small lights. Since the road is almost flat, even the unexperienced can descend the mountain safely. The view of Busan at night, extending next to the decked road, is of course the joy that one can only have in Bongnaesan Mountain. \n\nFollowing the decked road from the observatory brings one to the relay station building, and from here a packaged road brings one to the foot of the mountain. The road is lit well, so there's no need for concern. Walk about 10 minutes down to find the Jonaegi Sweet Potato History Park and the end of the trail.\n\nEven though the trek starts after sunset, make sure to bring enough water for hydration. Don't overexert, take your time, and we recommend going there in groups or in pairs, rather than alone. Another good idea is to bring a flashlight for darkness.﻿\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "A maritime city with blue seas, Busan has more than 100 lighthouses. Lighthouses with unique shapes and fascinating stories are among the most popular tourist attractions. Aside from guiding ships safely into ports, these lighthouses also provide interesting sights for tourists, enhancing the attraction of tourist destinations.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Cheongsapo Fishing Port Southern·Northern Breakwater Lighthouse (Twin Lighthouse) </p> Cheongsapo Port is located between Haeundae and Songjeong. It boasts a beautiful sea view and a quiet atmosphere. Twin Lighthouse, the symbol of Cheongsapo, is a representative photo spot. Unfortunately, the white lighthouse among the twin lighthouses was temporarily demolished in August due to a crack in the breakwater. However, the red lighthouse, which stands out against the emerald sea, is loved by tourists. \nIt’s easy to find cafes and restaurants near the light house, as well as the bus stop with the white lighthouse. Cheongsapo is a good place for a friendcation because there are many places to take pictures. \nThere is the \"Green Railway\" trail along the railroad of the seaside train from Mipo to Songjeong. As you walk along the decking trail, you can enjoy the green forest, the blue sea, and the seaside train. You will soon arrive at the Daritdol Observatory if you walk along the Green Railway from Cheongsapo. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the sea from Daritdol Observatory, which is 20 meters high and 72.5 meters long.  \n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Seoam Port Southern Breakwater Lighthouse (Baby Bottle Lighthouse) </p> There is a unique lighthouse at Seoam Port in Yeonhwa-ri. While it may look like a sculpture, it is an actual lighthouse that lights up at night. It was built by Busan Regional office of oceans and Fisheries in 2009, wishing for childbirth. The official name of the lighthouse is Seoam Port Southern Breakwater Lighthouse. \nBaby Bottle lighthouse, measuring 4.8 meters high, is decorated with ceramics featuring hand and footprints of 144 children under age 2. Now there are cute drawings of families too. It is a perfect photo spot with a unique design. On the opposite side of the Baby Bottle Lighthouse, there is a chariot-shaped red lighthouse, which is nicknamed “Cockscomb Lighthouse” for its unusual shape.  \nIf you take a short walk along the road after visiting unique lighthouses, soon you’ll find the Jukdo Island, Yeonhwa-ri, the only island in Gijang-gun. It is connected to the land via a bridge. The island is full of bamboo and camellia, so you can enjoy the fresh air. As there are many cafes and restaurants with great ocean views, it's a great place to stay from day to night. Due to its relaxing atmosphere, Yeonhwa-ri is a popular destination for couples. \n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Chiram Port Southern Breakwater Lighthouse (Baseball Lighthouse) </p> There are several unique lighthouses at Chiram Port, which is just up the coastline from Ilgwang Beach. \nShapes and colors vary widely, from baseball bat-shaped “Baseball Lighthouse” to “Seagull Lighthouse” and “Eel Lighthouse”. The red seagull represents Busan, and the yellow eel represents Chiram Port.  “Baseball Lighthouse” was built to commemorate the winning of the baseball championship of 2008 Beijing Olympic Games in Busan, the city of baseball. On the inside wall of the baseball-shaped sculpture is an exhibition of the achievements and photos of Choi Dong-won, the legendary pitcher of the Lotte Giants. \nEnjoy a stroll along the promenade from Chiram Port to Baseball Lighthouse in the cool sea breeze. Families with children will especially enjoy making good memories at this unique lighthouse. In the evenings, when the sun sets, the Baseball Lighthouse illuminates Chiram Port. It is also beautiful at night, so many tourists visit here to take pictures at the end of the journey. Take beautiful photos and make good memories at unique lighthouses in Busan! \n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Summer is over and autumn has come with cool breezes blowing throughout the day. It’s the best season for travel. Let’s take a trip to Haeundae Green Railway and take a walk while admiring Busan’s blue sea today. I hope you enjoy the autumn of Busan as you walk along the coastal railroad where the beach train runs. \n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Gudeokpo Old Mug</p> The beach train runs along the old Donghae Nambu Line from Songjeong Beach to Mipo, Haeundae. As it runs along the sea, it is one of the most scenic train rides in Korea. Passengers line up even on weekdays because it is Busan's most representative attraction. You can also walk along the railroad tracks on a newly built trail. Real coastal trekking can be only experienced in Busan by walking along the 4.8km of coastal decks. \n\nIf you walk along the coastal decks from Songjeong Beach, you will soon arrive at Gudeokpo. This small fishing village adjacent to Songjeong Beach is nowadays popular in Busan for its unique cafes. Among them is Old Mug, a drip coffee specialty store. Because of the tall trees, you will feel as if you are in a deep forest once you go down the stairs connecting to decks. The sound of the waves is constantly heard, and the blue sea is seen through the trees. The outhouse looks like a European lodge and is popular with Instagrammers.\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Cheongsapo<p> If you walk along the coastal decks from Old Mug, you will arrive at Cheongsapo in 30 minutes. It takes half a day just to find nice cafes hidden all over town. The alleyways with witty murals are also fun to explore. As a treasure of Busan where tourists taking pictures of unfamiliar seascapes and fishermen indifferently drying their fishing gear in the air coexist, Cheongsapo is a place to discover Busan differently.\n\nCheongsapo's Mongdolhaebyeon Beach is another attraction. Previously, the area was a military protected area that was closed to the general public, but now that a coastal deck road has been built, anyone can access it. Pebbles cover the beach, which stretches about 200 meters between unique rock formations. The waves roll the pebbles beautifully every time they come in.\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Ocean Breeze Cafe</p> A nice cafe opened at a place with a good view of Cheongsapo. As its name suggests, “Ocean Breeze” is a newly built cafe where you can enjoy a cool sea breeze. The blue sea can be seen from anywhere in the three-story building made of exposed concrete. In spite of the lovely view from the large window, the outdoor terrace offers an even better view. The terrace offers a good view of coastal decks too. I love watching the colorful beach trains and the cute little sky capsules come and go in the background of the blue sea.\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Haeundae No. 1 Jogaegui</p>When the sun sets and the sky turns orange, it’s time for Cheongsapo’s famous grilled clams. As there are many grilled clam restaurants in Cheongsapo, it has long been a popular place for Busan residents. Haeundae No. 1 Jogaegui stands out on the coast of Cheongsapo. There are palm trees in front of the building, giving the impression that you are in a tourist attraction in Southeast Asia. The clams served in a ship-shaped wooden tray are very fresh. The taste of clams grilled over briquettes is the highlight of a trip to Cheongsapo. A window seat with a view of the sea is the best spot in the store, which has been decorated like a resort. Eating grilled clams while watching the sunset in Cheongsapo will melt away the fatigue of travel like snow.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Jeonpogonggu-gil, transforming into a “hip” place as trendy cafes and ateliers emerge one after another on the site where the old tool shops used to spread, is becoming popular among domestic and foreign tourists. You can find nice cafes, prop stores, restaurants, and pop-up shops here, and you can get a sense of Jeonpo-dong's history as well.\n\nJeonpogonggu-gil's murals, trick art, and unusual exteriors make it a fun place to look around, and they blend naturally with the old tool shops that still remain, creating a unique atmosphere. \nJeonpogonggu-gil has become a popular alley with various shops that are full of colorful exteriors, cute little props, gorgeous lights, and decoration. Many travelers love to leave a nice photo at this hip place.\n\nWalking slowly, I look around the alley. Along the alley, stores are lined up, making it easy to browse. Cafes, restaurants, prop stores, and ateliers are all flourishing with their own charm. It creates a peaceful and picturesque atmosphere that cannot be found in a busy downtown area. Time flies when you look around from shop to shop with eye-catching interiors.\n\nThere are also many nice restaurants in the alley. You can enjoy generous portions of salmon, soy sauce marinated shrimps, beef tartare with rice. You can also have traditional American handmade burgers in a New York-themed restaurant. After taking a stroll in the alley, I think it would be great to have some coffee at the dessert cafe.\n\nAlso worth a visit while strolling through this alley is Jeollidan Gallery, which is an exhibition and atelier space for young artists. There is a Young Artist Exhibition held regularly at the moment. From September 6th to September 24th, artist Cho Youngsoo's <Beside Time> was held.\nThere are a number of unique shops on Jeonpogonggu-gil that you can't find anywhere else in Busan, a hip place from day to night. It is an alley that offers a special experience not only to travelers from afar, but also to Busan residents. It is a familiar yet unfamiliar alley that gives me a sense of excitement. \n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "A concert by BTS will take place in Busan on October 15th, in the hope that Busan will be chosen to host the World Expo 2030. As Busan is the hometown of BTS members Jimin and Jungkook, the concert has a special meaning for BTS and their fans. My itinerary in Busan included places meaningful to Jimin and Jungkook.\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">The Jungkook Route</p><p class=\"font-size20 medium\">Baekyang Elementary School – Paekyang Middle School – Mandeok Lego Village – Seokbulsa Temple – Mandeok Pass Trail Observation Deck – Hwamyeon Arboretum – Hwamyeong Eco Park – Gamcheon Culture Village</p>\nJungkook's alma maters, Baekyang Elementary School and Paekyang Middle School, are popular pilgrimage spots for BTS fans. Baekyang Elementary School is a 10-minute walk from Exit No. 1 of Mandeok Station. I looked around the neighborhood where Jungkook grew up as I was walking like taking a stroll. Peaceful and quiet Mandeok-dong has a friendly and warm atmosphere. \nThe colorful roofs in Mandeok Lego Village, which lies just next to Baekyang Elementary School and Paekyang Middle School, looks like LEGO blocks from a high point. There are 54 households friendly clustered in an apartment built in 1986. The road from Baekyang Elementary School to Mandeok Lego Village and Paekyang Middle School was lovely, so it was good for taking pictures. While taking a walk, I thought Jungkook grew up in a lovely neighborhood.\n\nBaekyang Elementary School\n12, Sangni-ro 18beon-gil, Buk-gu, Busan\nExit No. 3 of Mandeok Station on Busan Metro Line No. 3 → Transfer to town shuttle bus Bukgu 9 at Mandeok Station Bus Stop → A 1-minute walk from 304, Good Morning Hill Bus Stop\n\nPaekyang Middle School / Mandeok Lego Village\n70, Sangni-ro, Buk-gu, Busan / 40, Eunhaengnamu-ro 23beon-gil, Buk-gu, Busan\nExit No. 3 of Mandeok Station on Busan Metro Line No. 3 → Transfer to town shuttle bus Bukgu 8 or Bukgu 9 at Mandeok Station Bus Stop → A 9-minute walk / A 5-minute walk from Baegyang Mall Bus Stop\n\n\n\n\nAfter looking around Jungkook’s alma mater, I walked to Byeongpungam Seokbulsa Temple situated in the green mountains. Located at about 1.7km from Paekyang Middle School, Seokbulsa Temple can be reached by walking for about 30 minutes at a leisurely pace through a beautiful road. There are Instagrammable cafes on the way to Seokbulsa Temple, along with a path through the dense forest. In addition to walking trails, there are driveways and public parking lots, so you can either walk or drive.\nThe temple’s name is derived from the magnificent cliff that surrounds it like a folding screen (called “Byeongpung” in Korean). Besides the temple's distinctive appearance, Mandeok-dong's panoramic view is a must-see. Taking a walk along Jungkook's memorable places can help you get away from the city and relax in beautiful nature, which is why it’s a worthwhile route if you are a BTS fan traveling to Busan. \n\nSeokbulsa Temple\n143-79, Mandeokgogae-gil, Buk-gu, Busan\n10 minutes by taxi from Exit No. 1 of Mandeok Station on Busan Metro Line No. 3\nParking: Seokbulsa Temple Parking Lot\n\n\n\nVisit other tourist destinations near Mandeok-dong, the hometown of Jung Kook, and explore the hidden charms of Busan. The Nurigil Observation Deck on Mandeok Pass creates a beautiful view especially at dusk because of all the lightings. We recommend you to go there by car. Located on Jangsan Mountain in Haeundae, it’s a special place to enjoy a panoramic view of the Marine City as well as the picturesque scenery of Hwangnyeongsan Mountain.

The splendid landscape with trees and flowers can help you heal yourself, especially when the leaves are red. The forest air is rich in phytoncide, making it a great place to relax and meditate. The greenhouse is also worth a visit as there are many rare plants to appreciate and so is the maze of trees, where children can play hide and seek. When the weather gets cooler and leaves become colorful, many families and couple alike visit Hwamyeong Arboretum in Busan to enjoy the autumn foliage.\n\nHwamyeong Arboretum\n299, Sanseong-ro, Buk-gu, Busan\nExit 6 of Hwamyeong Station on Busan Metro Line 2 → Transfer to Village Bus Geumjeong-gu 1 → Get off at Hwamyeong Arboretum\nParking: Hwamyeong Arboretum Parking Lot\n\n\n\nSo come visit Hwamyeong Ecological Park blooming with cosmos flowers if you happen to be in the area in autumn!\nAt Hwamyeong Ecological Park, there are yellow cosmos flowers around Parking Lot P3 and pink cosmos flowers in the lotus garden near Parking Lot P4. You can either take a slow walk in the park while enjoying the river breeze or rent a bicycle to take a bike around the area. \nThe long, beautiful tree-lined trail is a perfect place to walk or ride a bike.

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Where is the best beach in Busan to stroll in the cool autumn breeze? Though it is not as popular as Haeundae Beach or Gwangalli Beach, Songjeong Beach might be the answer. In particular, its night sea will surely provide you with the relaxation of autumn. Let’s walk along the Songjeong night sea after work with a light heart. \n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Is there a modern cultural heritage of Korea at Songjeong Beach?</p>Songjeong Station is a small and pretty flag station that looks like a station from a movie and can be reached by a short walk from Songjeong Beach through the alley opposite the beach. Built in 1941, the station was designated as a National Registered Cultural Heritage because it retains its 1940s architecture.\nCurrently, Songjeong Station serves as the terminus of the Haeundae Blueline Park, which runs along the beautiful coast of Haeundae and Songjeong. Travelers to Busan are recommended to take the beach train from the Blueline Park Mipo Station to Songjeong Beach and walk around Songjeong. Inside Songjeong Station, you can see the platform that keeps its original appearance. Can there be any place that excites travelers more than an old train station?\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Refreshing while walking on the night sea of Songjeong!</p>To Busan locals, Songjeong Beach is a place full of memories, such as playing leisurely in the ocean instead of crowded Haeundae Beach or having fun all night with friends during school days. Let’s walk along the sandy beach when the sun is setting down. In summer, the daytime will be good to swim in the sea under the sun. In autumn, however, it is better to walk on a sandy beach after sunset while listening to the waves blown by the autumn breeze.\nThere is something you should not miss when taking a walk on the seashore at night. It is a midnight snack! There are many different kinds of midnight snacks near Songjeong Beach, but the two kinds of snacks you must try are corn dog and toast. There are famous corn dog and toast stores as well as food trucks along the beach. Midnight snacks and busking add fun to the stroll along Songjeong Beach at night. \n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Jukdo Park with beautiful pine trees and a pavilion</p>There is a small park called Jukdo Park at the end of Songjeong Beach. A lot of bamboo trees were the reason it was originally called Jukdo (“bamboo island”), but now Jukdo Park is surrounded by beautiful pine trees. A deck path and lighting make it a good place to walk at night. \nEnjoy a stroll along the forest road with pine tree scents carried by the autumn wind while gazing at the illuminated night sea. The stroll will lead you to a beautiful pavilion called Songiljeong Pavilion. The pavilion is known as a place where you can see the sunrise and sunset. Especially in the evening, when the sun has set and the sky begins to darken, the night sea of Songjeong viewed serenely from Songiljeong Pavilion provides perfect refreshment for the tired mind.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "BTS will hold a concert in Busan on October 15, 2022 in hopes that Busan will be the host city of the World Expo 2030. The concert can have a special meaning not only for BTS fans but also for its members because Busan is the hometown of two of the group members - Jimin and Jungkook. Since we have already introduced some of the most memorable places for Jungkook and Jimin, this time we will follow the footsteps of V and RM so we can show you the places they have been to while they were visiting Busan.\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Busan Citizens Park <p>Busan Citizens Park is one of the places V visited, and its themes of activity are Culture, Pleasure, Nature, and Participation. It's a great place to take a short walk and for picnicking when the weather is nice.\nThe fastest way to the place where V took his photos is through the South Gate. If you are driving, you can use the Busan Citizens Park Parking Lot (public) in front of the South Gate. \nGo through the South Gate, and you will see a sign to Busan Citizens Park. Facing the sign, take the road to the left.\nGo through the entrance, and you will see a map of the place. We recommend you to check your current location on the map before starting your tour around the park.\nWithin a short walking distance from the South Gate, you will come across pavilion called Citizens Floor. Turn right before reaching the Citizens Floor pavilion.\nYou will see the trail where V had his photos taken. It's a picturesque place with rows of trees and blue sky. On the ground, you will see a mark on which V took his photos.  Strike the same pose as V for your photos!\nAfter the photo spot, there is a playground for children. It's a fairy-like place designed like a fairy village with all the cute little things. There were a lot of picnickers in the park since it’s also popular as a picnic ground. However, since no tents or shade canopies are allowed here, have a picnic mat ready if you want to have a picnic.\n\nBusan Citizens Park\n73 Simingongwon-ro, Busanjin-gu, Busan\nA 5 minute walk from Exit 7 of Bujeon Station, Subway Line 1\nParking: Busan Citizens Park Parking Lot\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Busan Museum of Art<p>Well-known for his love of art, RM goes to art galleries pretty often. RM visited the Busan Museum of Art in 2019, 2020, and this year.\nLet's go take a look inside the Busan Museum of Art, which is divided into main and annex buildings (Space Lee Ufan).\nStep into the entrance, and you will be able to buy a ticket right there and then. Admission is currently free because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nOn my way to the Museum held on the third floor of the main building was one of the exhibitions RM went, and it will be there until October 16, 2022. It looks they’re preparing for a new exhibition. \nEverything Affects Each Other is an exhibition of the Busan Museum of Art’s collection dedicated to the history of Busan. ANGULAR CIRCLE: Kim Yongkwan presented in the Children’s Gallery on the first basement floor is a unique artwork made of figures.\nGo get to Space Lee Ufan in the annex building, go out the door on the opposite side of the first floor entrance. It's where RM’s autograph is. His autograph is in the cafe on the first floor of Space Lee Ufan.\nFor your information, no photos are allowed in Space Lee Ufan, so it wouldn’t be a bad idea to just focus on the artwork.\n\nBusan Museum of Art (Closed on every Monday)\n58 APEC-ro, Haeundae-gu, Busan\nExit 5, BEXCO (Busan Museum of Art) Station, Subway Line 2\nParking: Busan Museum of Art Parking Lot\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Cine Road <p>BTS stayed at Park Hyatt in 2019 when they had a concert in Busan. At the time, they showed Gwangandaegyo Bridge from their hotel room on their SNS and live live broadcast.\nRM also posted a photo of Gwangandaegyo Bridge from Park Hyatt. You can get a similar view from Cine Road. At dusk, there were many people on Cine Road taking photos of Gwangandaegyo Bridge.\nTake pictures of Gwangandaegyo Bridge over the ocean and under the sky while taking a walk on Cine Road.\n\nCine Road\n91 Marine City 1(il)-ro, Haeundae-gu, Busan\nA 18 minute walk from Exit 3 of Dongbaek Station, Subway Line 2\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Gwangalli Beach\n<p>Gwangalli Beach is a must-visit attraction in Busan. Gwangalli Beach commands a great view of both Gwangandaegyo Bridge and Park Hyatt.\nIt may be why Gwangalli Beach has always been one of the most popular places in the city. During the day, a combination of shimmering waves and Gwangandaegyo Bridge offers a splendid view.\nAt night, lights on the bridge add to the scenery to create an even more beautiful view. The bridge was lit with purple lights in 2019 when BTS held a concert in Busan. At the time, Jimin shared the view on his SNS and V live.\nA drone show takes place on every Saturday night, making the night view of Gwangalli Beach even more spectacular.\nSo it won’t be a bad idea to watch the drone show if you happen to be there on Saturday.\n<Gwangalli M (Marvelous) Drone Light Show>\nApril 2 (Sat) - Dec. 31, 2023 (Sun) \n20:00-22:00 (Mar-Sep)\n19:00-21:00 (Oct-Feb)\nGwangalli Beach hosts 2 performances on every Saturday\n\nGwangalli Beach\n219 Gwanganhaebyeon-ro, Suyeong-gu, Busan\nA 13 minute walk from Exit 5 of Gwangan Station, Subway Line 2 \nParking: Gwangalli Beach Parking Lot (Public)\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Busan displays a variety of features with its bridges, ports, skyscrapers, and mountains. In particular, there are many mountains in the city, and there are roads on the mountains, so you can enjoy a variety of sights. Furthermore, Busan's landscape is topped off by a number of large bridges. The scenery is at its most beautiful during the night, and you can enjoy it without thought along with the white noise of the city. Today, I will introduce you to a few secret night view spots where you can enjoy your own time.\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Donggu Library Chaengmaru Observatory</p> It is a very quiet place located among the residential areas on the hill. In addition, Webtoon Street is nearby, so taking a leisurely stroll will take you to the Donggu Library at the end of the street. Located on a high hill, the library converted its rooftop into an observatory for the public. The observatory is available to anyone without using the library and is easily accessible by elevator on the right side of the entrance.\nThe book-shaped photo spot is the first thing that draws your attention after entering the observatory. If you step onto the photo spot, you can see the Busan's sparkling city view. The panoramic view will take your breath away. People who come alone can easily take pictures with the smartphone holder provided, so there is no need to worry. You have only to take lots of nice pictures! \nAnother observatory can be found by climbing the pencil-shaped stairs on the left, and its photo zone looks like a TV set. The sculpture of pencils in a book and the book-shaped bench are also very cute. The romantic night view of the hillside roads, where street lamps twinkle like stars, spreads out beneath the library.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Yeongdo Sunrise Observatory</p> Yeongdo’s Bongnaesan Observatory and Cheonghak Reservoir Observatory are some of Busan’s best night view spots. Although you have to climb uphill, both places have good accessibility, so many people visit them regardless of weekdays and weekends. On the other hand, Sunrise Observatory located at the top of a quiet village is a perfect place for those who want to enjoy their solitude.\nIf you climb up slowly along the alleyway of the village, you will see a white observatory. It may be a little scary because the building is dim inside, but as soon as you enter, the sensor light detects movement and lights up brightly. On taking steps up to the rooftop equivalent to the third-floor height, you will find yourself in a completely new world.\nThe feeling of fear flies off when you see the open scenery of Busanhangdaegyo Bridge. The time spent grumbling while climbing up the rather long uphill disappears from your memory. From Cheonghak-dong right in front to Busanhangdaegyo Bridge shining in five colors and Busan International Passenger Terminal, the warm night view is enchanting. A beautiful serenity surrounds you. Now all you have to do is to spend some quite time for yourself.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Bokcheonsa Temple</p>Bokcheonsa Temple, located at the foot of Bongnaesan Mountain, is famous for its sunset and night view. The temple is not well-known, perhaps because of the high slope to reach to the temple, but if you visit in person, you will soon find it a stunning place. Although the temple size is not large, everywhere makes a good photo spot because of the temple’s distinctive serene atmosphere and beautiful scenery.\nThe main place to appreciate Bokcheonsa Temple’s night view is the Observation Deck in front of Sansingak Hall, which can be reached by the stairs beside the Daeungjeon Hall. You will see the beautiful harmonious landscape of Bokcheonsa Temple and Namhangdaegyo Bridge at the Observation Deck. It is strongly recommended to visit in time for sunset.\nIt is not clearly visible during the day, but at night, the candle becomes a feature and seems to fill up the dark scenery with warmth. If you stand on the railing next to Cheonwangmun Gate, you will be able to see the beautiful night view of Namhangdaegyo Bridge and Songdo, so don’t forget to stop by before you go down!\n\n**Tip\nParking below the temple is available, but cautious driving is required as it is a slope.\nIt is also possible to park at Sinseon 3-dong Public Parking Lot and walk 10 min to get to Bokcheonsa Temple.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Has Yeongdo Island ever been in the spotlight like it is today? Not only Busan citizens but also tourists are visiting Yeongdo Island. What makes Yeong-do so attractive? ’We have prepared this travel guide to show you how to fully enjoy the attractions of Yeongdo Island. I hope you thoroughly enjoy traveling in Yeongdo Island with your friends and family.\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Achidulle-gil</p>Jodo Island, located near Taejongdae, is a small island connected to Yeongdo Island. It doesn’t feel like an island because there is a road where cars can travel, but it is still an island.the entire island is a campus of Korea Maritime and Ocean University, so you can enjoy a unique landscape no other island ’offers.\n\nAchisan Mountain stands tall on one side of the island, and the coastal cliff facing the sea is spectacular, with strange rocks created by waves over many years. It used to be a view that could only be seen by boat from the sea, but now it can be reached on foot. It is thanks to the recently built Achidulle-gil. It is also called Achinoeul-gil because the sunset is beautiful. While enjoying the panoramic of Busan Port and Oryukdo Island at a glance, you will soon find a deck road along the coastal cliff. The feeling of walking on the sea is both surprising and amazing. If you walk for another 10 minutes, you will reach the observatory at the end of Dulle-gil. It is so clear it seems like you could grasp Tsushima Island in the distance by hand.\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Marine Adventure Park Yeongdo</p>There is a Marine Adventure Park near Archidulle-gil. It is a marine leisure facility where you can enjoy various marine activities. You would not want to miss out on this when you come all the way to Busan. Idol group 'NewJeans' also recently traveled to Busan and visited. So experience the sea of Busan through an exhilarating marine activity.\nIf you want speed, try a jet boat. The jet boat, which can accommodate 12 people, can speed over the sea at 60 kilometers per hour as soon as it leaves the dock. Busanhangdaegyo Bridge, Oryukdo Island, and the Maritime Museum in the distance appear and disappear in front of you. Water splashes all over, strong winds rush into your face, and you feel refreshed.\nIf you want even more thrilling speed, Big Marvel is waiting for you. Big Marvel has jet skis that run at high speed and a four-person water slide that delivers the impact of the waves. The attraction of disco boats is the tension and thrill of not knowing where they will go. A round boat led by a jet ski constantly turns and shakes your whole body up and down.\nThere is also a paddle board where you can stand and row on the board. SUP yoga, which develops your core muscles while you balance on a paddle board, is also popular.\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Taejongdae Jjamppong</p>After you have enjoyed the marine activities, it is time to fill your stomach. Taejongdae Jjamppong, located at the entrance of Taejongdae, is a good restaurant for a light meal. It is a restaurant located in a famous tourist attraction, but it is also popular with locals. Jjamppong/Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup is a must visit destination. If you want to taste various flavors, you can order a combo for two people, served with Jjamppong/Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup, Jjajang/Noodles with Black Bean Sauce, and Tangsuyuk/Sweet and Sour Pork.\n\nThe signature menu, Jjamppong/Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup, contains plenty of seafood. The first taste is sweet, but it hits the spot, and the spiciness remains in the mouth at the end. The whole octopus is put on top, so it tastes good even just by looking at it. Jjamppong/Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup is the main menu, but you would not want to miss out on Jjajang/Noodles with Black Bean Sauce. Jjajang/Noodles with Black Bean Sauce served on a large plate-like tray also contains a lot of seafood’ It's not salty, but just right, so you cannot help eating it. Tangsuyuk/Sweet and Sour Pork is topped with sliced onions in a sweet and sour sauce. It is a combination that goes well with the savory tempura batter.\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Taejongdae</p>The last course of the Yeongdo trip is Taejongdae. T’day's mission is to take the pic of the day at Taejongdae! It is a representative tourist attraction in Busan, which tourists visit all year round thanks to its lush forest and superb coastal scenery, but there are great photo spots that even Busan citizens do not know.\n\nThe first point is the Yeongdo Lighthouse. The lighthouse, built on a sheer cliff, and the blue sea give off an exotic atmosphere. So if you go there in the afternoon when the sky is clear blue, you will see that the place is a great place to take some of the most memorable and beautiful photos. The second point is Taejongdae Observatory near Yeongdo Lighthouse. It is a place where you can enjoy a panoramic sea view from a round-shaped building like a spaceship, and there is also a cafe where you can relax while drinking tea. The quiet first floor is better for taking pictures than the crowded second and third floors. A table on the railing is a good spot. Finally, don't miss the southern port viewing point you cansee when you walk down the coastal road from the observatory.\n\nThe last point is a hill overlooking Taewon Gravel Yard. Do not go down the stairs to Taewon Gravel Yard, but walk along the forest road on the right, and then you will see the open space with a view of the sea. In addition to Taewon Gravel Yard, the sea of Busan, where ocean-going ships are anchored, beautifully appears under your feet. If you visit at sunset, you can take even more dramatic pictures.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Autumn is a great season to go for a walk. Busan is a place with many exceptional walking trails and is a known as the “City of Roads” thanks its mountains, sea, and rivers as well as its history of being Korea’s first international port and wartime capital. This is the season when the sky is high and the air is cool, providing a perfect weather to take a walk on a special walkway called stone wall street. \n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Beomeosa Temple Stone Wall Street - Most Distinctively Korean </p>Beomeosa Temple is a beautiful place particularly in autumn. Autumn leaves start to change color from Godangbong Peak of Geumjeongsan Mountain all the way down to Beomeosa Temple, where maple and ginkgo leaves turn red and yellow, making Beomeosa Street one of the 100 Scenic Trails of Korea. Talk a slow walk along the stone wall path at the entrance to Beomeosa Temple. The leaves have yet to turn color, but the breeze from Geumjeongsan Mountain is enough to let you know that autumn has come. Feel the breeze as you stroll up from Jogyemun Gate which is a national treasure, go past Cheonwangmun Gate and Burimun Gate. Before you know it, you will find yourself at the courtyard of the Daeungjeon Hall.\nFace the Daeungjeon Hall, which is also a national treasure, and the three-story stone pagoda in the courtyard and you will see why Beomeosa Temple is known as one of the three most important Buddhist temples in Gyeongsang-do along with Haeinsa Temple and Tongdosa Temple. The blue and red paintings on the Daeungjeon Hall add to the autumn scenery with the blue sky over the ancient building. \nTake your time walking around the stone wall path. The stone walls are low enough for you to see your surroundings. Made of clay and stones, the stone walls give way to a path where you will see why the stone wall path is one of the best ways to feel the sentiment and beauty of Korea. The stone and clay walls at Beomeosa Temple are one of the most distinctively Korean because of not only the materials but also the roof tiles that cover the top of the walls. \nThere are two stone wall streets you don’t want to miss at Beomeosa Temple. They are the stone wall street between the Daeungjeon Hall and the trail leading to Geumjeongsan Mountain to the right, and the bamboo stone wall street winding down from the front yard of the Daeungjeon Hall to the left. The bamboo stone wall street leads to another stone wall street that turns into a downward stairway, which is known as one of the most beautiful spots in the area especially with the autumn foliage. \n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Seonamsa Stone Wall Street in Nature </p>Seonamsa Temple, located at the foot of Baegyangsan Mountain, was built a Buddhist monk named Wonhyo in 675 during the Silla period. The temple was originally named Gyeongangsa when it was first built, but was renamed to Seonamsa Temple because it was where the “flowering knights” of Silla called Hwarang trained. Surrounded by a cliff of Baegyangsan Mountain and commanding a panoramic view of downtown Busan, Seonamsa Temple is one of the most visited attractions in the city. \nStep inside the temple, and you will the Daeungjeon Hall and Geungnakjeon Hall and a big pine tree, which are a testament to the ancient antiquity of the temple. The courtyard of the temple is low and surrounded by low stone walls. It would be a good idea to take a leisurely walk around the temple’s stone walls and sit on the bench to rest and meditate. \nUnlike the stone walls of Beomeosa Temple, the stone walls at Seonamsa Temple are made only of stones with roof tiles on the top. Many visitors find the walls comforting, and build a small stone tower on the top of the wall as they make a wish. There is a stairway between the stone wall paths behind the right side of the Daeungjeon Hall, and it will lead you up to Chilseonggak and Geungnakjeon Hall. There, you will see yet another beautiful stone wall that is covered with moss. If you want to feel the season of autumn and see the beautify of Korean stone walls, Seonamsa Temple just might be the place. \n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Ongnyeonseonwon Stone Wall Street with Roof Tile Walls</p>Baeksan Mountain is a small mountain located behind Subyeon Park in Millak-dong next to Gwangalli Beach in Busan. At the foot of the mountain is Ongnyeonseonwon Temple, which is known to have been built by a Buddhist monk named Wonhyo in 670. The word “seonwon” is used in the names of Buddhist establishments dedicated for seon training and practice. \nOngnyeonseonwon Temple is popular for its beautiful view and its vicinity to the city. Behind the temple is Korea’s largest seated Buddha statue where you can enjoy a commanding view of the skyscrapers of the Marine City and an ocean view in between them. \nThe stone walls at Ongnyeonseonwon Temple are unique in that they are made of roof tiles instead of clay and stones. The roof tile walls form a path from the entrance to the temple to the courtyard of the temple. They are relatively higher than most other stone walls, but the roof tiles create an air of tranquility. There are different types stone walls at the temple, and many visitors find it amusing that there is a stone wall in every corner of the temple grounds. One of the aesthetic features of the place is the earthen jars under the stone walls leading to the seated Buddha statue. Take a walk on the beautiful stone wall path and enjoy the cool breeze of autumn. \n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Just as fashion that was popular in the past will be fashionable again in the present one day, I sometimes miss the vibes of the old days when new things are constantly being created. There are quite a few places in Busan with the retro vibes, but today I visited a vintage spot full of analog vibes. So if you would like to enjoy the vibes of those days, check out the Busan vintage spot introduced today.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Geumgang Botanical Garden</p>Geumgang Botanical Garden in Oncheon-dong was established in 1969 as Korea's first private botanical garden. These days, old facilities are often refurbished over time, but that is not the case here, so you can feel that it is an old place from the entrance.\nAdmission is pretty cheap at 1,000 won. As soon as you buy a ticket and enter, you can see the road covered in blue, and you will start to relax immediately. If you go up the stone stairs in front of you, you will see that it’s covered with moss here and there, and the traces of time are all over the place, giving you a mysterious feeling.\nEven though Geumgang Botanical Garden is not a large place, there are various trees and flowers, and the internal facilities, such as a greenhouse and a small artificial fountain, are well maintained. \nAs you take a walk while enjoying the refreshing scent of wood, you will arrive at the greenhouse located above. The moss, ivy vines, and old iron structures covering the greenhouse outside give a retro feel. Although the interior was small, it was a beautiful space with sunlight penetrating the window and filled with a variety of species, such as 580 species of tropical plants and 540 types of succulents.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Busandaegyo Bridge</p>There are many bridges in Busan: Gwangandaegyo Bridge, Busanhangdaegyo Bridge, Yeongdodaegyo Bridge, Hwamyeongdaegyo Bridge, and more. And there is a bridge that many people cross often without even knowing tis name. It is Busandaegyo Bridge. A lot of people mistake Busandaegyo Bridge for Busanhangdaegyo Bridge, but the bridge right next to Yeongdodaegyo Bridge is Busandaegyo Bridge.\n\nThe construction of Busandaegyo Bridge began in 1976 and was completed in 1980 after an explosive increase in traffic in this part of the city. Busan Port celebrated its 100소 anniversary ii 1976.. At the time, Busandaegyo Bridge was not only a symbol of the port opening, but quite a colorful bridge built with Korean technology and materials. Therefore, it was a bridge that served as a city landmark until Gwangandaegyo Bridge was built.\nThere are two stairs and an elevator at each end of Busandaegyo Bridge for pedestrians, but there is some inconvenience due to the narrow sidewalk. However, the cool breeze felt from the top of the bridge provides an enjoyable experience. Around Busandaegyo Bridge, there are a number of places that offer a panoramic view of the bridge such as Lotte Department Store Sky Garden or Lavalse Hotel Roof Garden, in addition to many attractions such as Yeongdodaegyo Bridge, Busanhangdaegyo Bridge, and Busan Port, all of which are worth a visit.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Yangdabang</p>If you want to enjoy real retro, there is a place you must go. It is Yangdabang, located in Kangkangee Arts Village. The vibes from the exterior made me feel as if I had entered the 60s.\nAs soon as I opened the door and entered, the inside seemed like it had been frozen in the 1960s and 70s, as if I had traveled back in time. Although I had never lived in that era, I looked around curiously for a long time in wonder because it seemed as if it had been taken from a movie or a drama. Every little item, including the furniture and the interior, was truly vintage. The taste of the medicianal herb tea called “ssanghwacha” I tried for the first time was also exquisite. It's not too far from Busandaegyo Bridge, so I recommend you visit it as well.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Bosu-dong Book Street</p>During the Korean War, when Busan was the provisional capital, the present-day Bosu-dong Book Street began by selling magazines from units of United States Forces Korea. Dozens of stores have been built since the first bookstore, but as time passed, many have disappeared, and only a few have remained.\n\nAs soon as you enter the alley, you can see old books piled up on old bookshelves and sales tables, giving off very different vibes from modern bookstores. Some of the books are currently on sale in the market, but if you look closely, you may find books that are not available in the market now, so people looking for such books come. In the past, it used to be crowded with people buying, selling, or exchanging books, but now it is filled with people looking for retro alley vibes.\nToday, new small cafes and book-related sculptures are opening all over Bosu-dong Book Street, making it a perfect place for tourists. In the middle of the street, the stairs and ivy showing traces of time add to the weight of many years, creating a dream-like atmosphere.\nOnce you enter the street, you have to walk slowly and look closely. And if you find a book you like, it would be a good idea to buy it. So enjoy the slow flow of time amid the books piled up on the old bookshelves.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "Autumn is deepening. The autumn leaves fall on the Baekdudaegan Mountain Range, the largest mountain range in Korea, which begins at Baekdusan Mountain and extends to Jirisan Mountain. Nakdongjeongmaek starts at the foot of Taebaeksan Mountain in the middle of the Baekdudaegan Mountain Range, passes through Juwangsan Mountain, Gajisan Mountain, and continues to the tip of Busan, Dadaepo Morundae Peninsula. Today, I would like to introduce 'Siyaksan Mountain,' which is located at the end of Nakdongjeongmaek Mountain Range and offers the best view of Busan, encompassing the sea, mountains, and rivers.\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Beautiful Forest Garden, Gudeok Culture Park</p>At the foot of Gudeoksan Mountain in Seo-gu, Busan, there is a pretty village called Kkot Village. Since ancient times, there have been many wildflowers here, and it was called Kkot Village because people who made a living selling these flowers lived there together. The beautiful forest garden located here is Gudeok Culture Park. The park has exhibition halls, waterfalls, ponds, flower paths, and walking paths, so it is an excellent place to feel autumn in the forest.\nThe must-visit places here are the Mokseok Horticultural Center and the Cypress Forest Meditation Path. At the Mokseok Horticultural Center you can see unique works made with stones, trees, and plants. Works made by growing plants on stones or trees are called “seokbujak” and “mokbujak” in Korean, and you can see about 100 works here. You can also see subtropical plants and fossils. Come enjoy the beauty created by nature and time.\nLet's walk slowly along the Cypress Forest Meditation Path before climbing Siyaksan Mountain. This beautiful forest trail starts at Gudeok Culture Park and runs along for about 250 meters. There are pines and cypress trees on the side of the forest path. Take a deep breath of phytoncides produced by the cypress trees and walk slowly through the forest. After all, nature restores people, and autumn is the best season to enjoy it.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">The Way up to Siyaksan Mountain</p>Now let's climb Siyaksan Mountain in earnest. If you go uphill for about 10 minutes following the signpost at the top of Gudeoksan Mountain, you will reach the forest path. It's a comfortable walk along the forest path. Wildflowers are blooming along the path, and the trees are colored with autumn leaves. If you walk slowly along this path for about 30 minutes, you will come to Jaeneomi Maruteo. This is the crossroads of Siraksan Mountain and Seunghaksan Mountain, famous for reeds.\nLet's move from Jaeneomi Maruteo to the top of Siyaksan Mountain. The view unfolds from here. On the right, you will see Seunghaksan Mountain, famous for its reeds, as well as a weather station at the top of Siyaksan Mountain. Korea has 11 weather stations equipped with a radar, and this weather station standing tall at the top of Siyaksan Mountain is one of them.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Panoramic view of Siyaksan Mountain embracing Busan</p> On the way to the weather station, the panoramic view of the eastern landscape of Busan spreads out before you to the left. Beyond Eomgwangsan Mountain, the view extends to Haeundae Beach, Busanhangdaegyo Bridge, and Yeongdo in the distance. The best place to see this view is at Siyakjeong Pavilion. While Hwangnyeongsan Mountain's beacon fire station is a place where you can see all of Busan from the center of Busan, the panoramic view of Busan Port, Yeongdo Island, and Gamcheon Port from Siyakjeong Pavilion remains the best way to take in the scenery of Busan as it is embraced by the mountains, the sea, and the ports.\nIt takes less than 5 minutes to reach the top of Siyaksan Mountain from Siyakjeong. The weather station towers over the top of the mountain, and if you stand here, you can quickly understand why it was installed here. The meandering mountain range extending from Baekdusan Mountain continues from this very place, Siyaksan Mountain, to Morundae, and finally leading to the sea. This is Busan, a city where mountains, seas, and ports harmonize.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">The End of a Trip, 'Kkot Village Provence</p>Let's head back to the starting point of the itinerary, Kkot Village. It takes 2 to 3 hours to climb Siyaksan Mountain from Gudeok Culture Park and return to Kkot Village. Recently, Kkot Village has been remodeled under the name of Kkot Village Provence. Kkot Village is particularly famous as a natural resting place close to the city center, and there are many delicious dishes to enjoy here. Sirakguk (dried radish leaf soup) is the one dish you absolutely must try. Godeungeo jorim (braised mackerel and various vegetables) are served along with sirakguk. The price is very low, and the taste is good, so it makes for a delicious meal after hiking in autumn.\nSiyaksan Mountain is not as well known as Geumjeongsan, Hwangnyeongsan, nor Jangsan Mountain, but these days, when autumn is deepening, if you are looking for a place where you can enjoy various sights, the scenery of Busan, and delicious food in just a half day, make the trek to Siyaksan Mountain and embrace Busan.\n\n\n"

October 1st is also International Coffee Day, designated by the International Coffee Organization. As such, coffee has become a special culture connecting the world as one. When it comes to ‘coffee,’ Busan is also indispensable because coffee beans from all coffee-producing regions in the world come through the Port of Busan and move across the country. As a result, Busan accounts for 95% of Korea's coffee traffic! Thanks to this, Busan is also the place where you can taste the freshest coffee beans.\n\nBusan is well-known as a place where you can experience coffee healing with excellent natural scenery. A place where specialties and small brands coexist as well as the International Coffee Museum. Immerse yourself in the charm of Busan, the coffee city where the Global Coffee Festival is held.\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">The International Coffee Museum<p>The old Busanjin Station, where trains no longer stop, has been transformed into a 'Cultural Platform Citizen's Yard' where various cultural programs and special performances are held for citizens through remodeling. Behind the warm pink building is a dense train track and the vast Port of Busan.\nOn the first floor of the building, there is a special space called ‘The International Coffee Museum.’ About 2000 coffee machines from all over the world are on display, so you can see the history of coffee machines around the world in one place.\nThis is a space where a variety of coffee equipment, carefully collected by a coffee lover, is displayed with detailed explanations. It is an exhibition that helps give a broader understanding of the history and culture of coffee. If you apply for a 'Docent Experience' where you can listen to unique episodes together, and you can enjoy the exhibition even more. There is also a one-day class where you can experience coffee extraction and even drink it. It will be a special experience that is not easily accessible as you can watch the brewing using various coffee equipment such as siphon, percolator, biggin, Turkish, and moka pot.\nThe Cultural Platform Citizen's Yard lights up at 6 pm and becomes a beautiful location wher you can enjoy the sunset. It would be nice to take a stroll after visiting the International Coffee Museum.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">1st Global Yeongdo Coffee Festival & Yeongdo Coffee-Specialized Street</p>In Yeongdo, one of Busan's coffee hot spots, a special coffee festival will be held in November. The Yeongdo Coffee Festival, which marks its 3rd anniversary this year following 2019 and 2021, is named 'Global' and has a much larger scale than before: 8 coffee producing countries, 2 major farm owners, 80 coffee industry companies, and 120 booths will participate. As a participatory coffee festival for residents, free coffee tasting and various hands-on events will be held, so it would be good to visit Amir Park in front of the Korea National Maritime Museum from November 4th to 6th.\n\nA coffee-specialized street is being built in the 600m section of Bongnaenaru-ro, Yeongdo-gu, Busan, attracting coffee enthusiasts: Blueport 2021, an exhibition and cultural space, Mumyeong Diary, a complex cultural space converted from an abandoned factory, and Momos Roastery & Coffee Bar, where you can see the entire coffee-making process. It will provide safety and convenience to pedestrians by reducing the width of the road and expanding the sidewalk, as well as installing sculptures with various designs to provide attractions, so you can look forward to Busan's new hot coffee place.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Momos Roastery & Coffee Bar</p>It is a cafe where you can see at a glance the process of coffee making: storing coffee beans, roasting, and packing. It is also represented by Barista Jeon Ju-yeon, the first Korean winner of the 2019 World Barista Championship. Inside the cafe, which was built by renovating the dock, you can fully observe and appreciate the process of storing green beans, roasting beans, and brewing coffee.\nThe 1:1 service, the biggest strength of Momos Coffee, is also unique. The barista in charge will give you detailed explanations while brewing the coffee, and you will be able to share some interesting stories. It can be an excellent time to satisfy your curiosity about coffee. The operation method of Momos, which proposes various ways to enjoy coffee beyond the limitations of existing cafes, seems to become another culture. You can purchase special Momos coffee that you can taste only in Busan, coffee beans, and goods you like as souvenirs, so it would be good to shop with a cup of coffee.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\"> Blackup Coffee Eulsukdo Branch<p>Blackup Coffee, Busan's must-visit cafe for coffee lovers, offers a variety of hand-drip coffee and unique drinks. In particular, the Eulsukdo branch has a beautiful garden with Pink Muhly grass, so it is good for taking pictures with coffee. The interior with wide windows also feels nice. You can enjoy hand-drip coffee while sitting at the bar and purchase your favorite coffee beans.\n\nBlackup Coffee's signature menu is 'Sea Salt Coffee,' with sweet cream on top of a cold brew sprinkled with salt. You can drink it straight away without stirring the cream, and the soft texture is excellent. The sweetness is felt first, followed by the savory taste. Finally, the salty taste follows. The salty taste reminiscent of the Busan sea is attractive. You can immerse yourself in the charm of Busan coffee by adding the beautiful scenery of Eulsukdo to the special taste of coffee.\n\n\n"

What if the pleasure of drinking is added to it? \nYou can taste craft beers from all over the country: traditional British beer made by Brits to preserve the taste and aroma of the home country, sour beer with a sweet and bitter flavor and refreshing scent, and Busan lager, which is very popular with beer lovers.

However, there is a place where a military camp is reborn as a park, namely Busan Citizens Park. You see the traces of history in the beautiful scenery in front of you—from the beginning of the Japanese colonial period in South Korea to the US Army Camp Hialeah and Busan Citizens Park. The “Pillars of Memory” still stand high, as they are recycled products of wooden power poles that remained in Camp Hialeah. This is a reminder that the park was once occupied by the US Army and had a difficult time to be back with the Busan citizens. This is why the park is very special and beautiful.\n\n<p class=\"font-size25 colorBlack medium\">Busan Citizens Park</p><a href=\"https://visitbusan.net/kr/index.do?menuCd=DOM_000000201001001000&uc_seq=354&lang_cd=en\" target=\"_blank\" alt=\"새창열림\" class=\"link-style1\">https://visitbusan.net/kr/index.do?menuCd=DOM_000000201001001000&uc_seq=354&lang_cd=en</a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Eulsukdo Island</p>It is a place where the main stem of the Nakdonggang River and the seawater of the South Sea intersects with each other, an ecological repository of rich soil and freshwater fish and shells, and a large-size winter home to migratory birds looking for enough food. Let’s visit Eulsukdo Island, one of Busan’s most beautiful islands. As the name suggests, which means a “clean island with birds,” it is widely known as Korea’s No. 1 bird sanctuary. Thus, it is highly recommended that you begin your journey to Eulsukdo Island at the Nakdong Estuary Eco Center, where you can enjoy various exhibitions on the ecological system of the Nakdong Estuary.\n\n<p class=\"font-size25 colorBlack medium\">Eulsukdo Island</p><a href=\"https://www.visitbusan.net/kr/index.do?menuCd=DOM_000000201001001000&uc_seq=304&lang_cd=en\" target=\"_blank\" alt=\"새창열림\" class=\"link-style1\">https://www.visitbusan.net/kr/index.do?menuCd=DOM_000000201001001000&uc_seq=304&lang_cd=en</a>\n\n\n"

Unfortunately, at the time of my visit, I couldn't see the flowers because they had already fallen. The metasequoia, ginkgo trees, and silver grass, which you can see in all their splendor around the park, will help you feel the autumn charm.\nIf you visit Hwamyeong Eco Park in the afternoon, the sunlight is warm and toasty, enhancing the autumn atmosphere. You can particularly enjoy the warm autumn feeling when you walk among the metasequoia trails near the 4th parking lot. The weather was delightful on the day I visited, so I saw many visitors enjoying picnics, walking, and exercising. Hwamyeong Eco Park is a pretty and large park with a look that suits each season, so you can enjoy various things, such as fields, trails, and the Nakdonggang River, no matter when you visit.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Railroad Trail in the Forest</p> Since the weather is quite cool these days, many people go for a walk in the afternoon.

This trail is a green area created to reduce noise from the Gyeongbu Line railroad.\n\nThe Railroad Trail in the Forest in Hwamyeong-dong is not that long, but the trees are planted quite densely, so you can feel like you are in the forest. In addition, most of the trees planted here are metasequoia and maple trees, so they are very green even in spring or summer, but when you visit in autumn, they are full of warm colors, so it feels  especially charming.\nIn addition, the walking trail is connected to Hwamyeong Eco Park, so if you enter the tunnel under the bridge in the middle, you can go to the park, making it an excellent place to visit both. There are various types of exercise equipment on the trail, so it's suitable for light exercise, and the forest library is there, so it's great to take out a book and sit on a nearby bench to spend time. Also, sitting in the shade of a tree or on a bench makes you feel like you are out of the city with just the intermittent sound of a train, so it would be good to visit this place when there is no shade in the ecological park.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Golden Sunset Bridge</p> You can see a splendid bridge when you pass Gupo on the riverside road at night. The Golden Sunset Bridge was completed in May of this year. It is a pedestrian bridge that connects Gupo Market and the lotus colony of Hwamyeong Eco Park. In the past, you had to go around for a long time to go to the lotus colony, but with the creation of the Golden Sunset Bridge, you don't have to turn around, so you can go to the lotus colony very comfortably.\n\nThe Golden Sunset Bridge is about four stories high, and you can climb up it by stairs. When you stand on the bridge, you can see the view of Gupo Market to Hwamyeong-dong from both sides. Also, passing on the railroad, you can see trains passing by if the time is right.\nIf you walk along the pedestrian bridge, there is an observatory at the end, so you can take a break and enjoy a cool breeze and a great view. As the name suggests, you can see a lovely sunset, so check the sunset time and visit the bridge. Also, the bridge is lit in various colors at night, making it a wonderful place to see the night view. So it is a perfect place to wait for a while, enjoy the sunset, and see the night view. \nThe Golden Sunset Bridge is not that long, so it is great place to go for a light walk. If you are looking for a different tourist destination in Busan, it would be pleasant to visit here.\n\n\n"

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "These days, the importance of the environment is  continuously increasing. Therefore, companies and countries are keen on environmental protection for sustainable development. In line with such a movement, eco-friendly travel products are appearing one after another.\n\nIntroducing a Busan travel course that allows you to travel and protect the Earth: an upcycling experience of making a porpoise doll with recycled cotton made from plastic bottles, getting a discount using multi-use containers instead of disposable items, and plogging to pick up trash while running along Gwangallihaebyeon Beach. So let's go together now!\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Oncheoncheon Stream Bicycle Riding</p> Oncheoncheon Stream, a representative urban stream in Busan, is full of autumn vibes these days. Various trees dressed in fine autumn leaves, including beautiful cherry trees lined up along the roadside, ginkgo trees, and crape myrtle, greet visitors. You can walk along the well-established promenade by the hot spring stream, but you can also enjoy a different feeling by riding a bicycle that is lent for free.\n\nYeonje-gu runs a free bicycle rental shop in front of Dongrae Hwashin Town Apartment Building 101. It operates from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm without days off, and if you leave your ID, you can rent a bicycle for free for up to 2 hours. We recommend the 3km course that goes down to Allakgyo Bridge and then changes direction to Sebyeonggyo Bridge. Thirty minutes is enough for a leisurely run while appreciating the surrounding scenery. If you ride your bike in the autumn breeze that still feels cool, you will be imbued with the autumn of Busan.\n\n101, Dongrae Hwashin Town Apartment, 2056-1, Yeonsan-dong, Yeonje-gu, Busan\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Yongginae Picnic</p>A vegan cafe has opened near Jeonpo Café Street, Busan's representative travel destination recognized by CNN. 'Ohh Good Thing'is a new cafe where you can enjoy various drinks with vegan dessert as the main menu. The cafe's inside has a bright and colorful atmosphere thanks to the large glass panes instead of walls. There are many photo spots throughout the cafe, so it is a good place to enjoy taking pictures.\n\nYou don't have to be nervous because it's a vegan cafe. Most of the drinks and desserts are made with ingredients you are familiar with, such as sweet potatoes, peaches, Injeolmi/Bean-powder-coated Rice Cakes, and Nurungji/Scorched Rice, so even those unfamiliar with vegan food can easily enjoy them. Vegan food tastes so good you will be surprised at the full and delicious flavors. To participate in environmental protection, we try to avoid disposable products as much as possible. If you bring a tumbler or packaging container, you get 300 won off, and 500 won for takeout.\n\n14, Jeonpo-daero 246beon-gil, Busanjin-gu, Busan \n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">’Usisan in Busan’ Upcycling Experience</p> The space under the old overpass has been transformed into a cultural complex space, Mangmi-dong B-Con Ground. The colorful containers are filled with galleries, cafes, restaurants, and social enterprises. People gathered under the abandoned overpass, and a new story was created.\n\nAt 'Usisan in Busan' in B-Con Ground, you can experience upcycling to create new value from waste plastic. It is a process to think about the use of waste plastic and pollution of the sea while making dolls of endangered sea creatures such as whales, seahorses, and sea turtles with cotton made from plastic bottles. You can also purchase various products, such as flower pots made from waste plastic, socks, shopping carts, and T-shirts.\n\nK-113, B-Con Ground, 69-1, Mangmibeonyeong-ro, Suyeong-gu, Busan\nClosed on Saturdays and Sundays\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Gwangalli Beach Plogging</p> If you want to protect the Earth more actively, try 'plogging.' Many people are already participating in 'plogging,' through which you pick up trash while jogging, as you can kill two birds with one stone, taking care of your health and protecting the environment. We recommend Gwangalli Beach, where you can run while looking at Gwangandaegyo Bridge, a landmark of Busan. You can feel Gwangalli Beach with your whole body and protect the Earth. Is there a better trip than this?\n\nThe length of the white sand at Gwangalli Beach is about 1.4 km. An hour is enough to try plogging while going back and forth across the entire sandy beach. You need simple things: one a garbage bag and gloves. Also, it is enough to wear comfortable walking shoes. You can run with a friend or run alone. If possible, try it early in the morning, before sunrise or around sunset. In winter, you can see the sun rising in the middle of Gwangandaegyo Bridge, so it is worth visiting even if you are not plogging.\n\n219, Gwanganhaebyeon-ro, Suyeong-gu, Busan\n\n\n"

The story of Busan connects the past and the present:  you can have a unique experience and time travel into the past. So why don’t you enjoy some new cultural experiences and make hapy memories?\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Bokbyeongsan Mountain Small Art Museum</p> The Jung-gu area, which played a central role during the modern development of Busan, still retains traces of that time here and there. For example, you can see a unique building, the Busan Jung-gu Cultural Center, which looks like a mixture of Japanese and Western architectural styles. The building, believed to have been built during the Japanese colonial era, was purchased by the Busan Jung-gu Office and transformed into the Jung-gu Cultural Center after a repair period.\nThe annex of the Jung-gu Cultural Center is considered a well-preserved Japanese-style warehouse in Korea and opened as Bokbyeongsan Mountain Small Art Museum in June by participating in a small art museum project organized by Arts Council Korea. The Bokbyeongsan Mountain Small Art Museum was recently holding a relay exhibition of <Street Photo> , and is planning to become an art museum specializing in photography. On the first and second floors, connected by a narrow staircase, you can see the photos of the colonial Japanese house taken by artist I Dong-geun.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Mangyang-ro Mountainside Road Exhibition Hall</p> If you pass Jwacheon-dong Furniture Street and climb a steep road from Beomgok Junction toward the mountain, you will reach Mangyang-ro Mountainside Road. ‘Mangyang-ro’, a road with a view of the sea, connects Dong-gu to Seo-gu and Busanjin-gu. If you follow this winding road, you can meet the ‘Mangyang-ro Mountainside Road Exhibition Hall,’ located on a curve that that you can easily miss at first glance. Since it is built on a hillside, you will first see the parking lot next to the road.\nAter passing through the entrance with mother-of-pearl decorations, you can hea straight to the exhibition hall. Busan, the temporary capital during the Korean War, enjoyed its heyday as a vibrant industrial city. Due to the rapid increase in population, residential areas were built up to the hillside, and the present mountainside road village was formed. It is a place where various exhibitions are held under the theme of the history of Busan, which contains the traces of such life, and the stories of people who flourished along the winding mountainside road.\n\nAfter viewing the exhibition that calmly conveys years of Busan history, you can return to the parking lot, where you will see the mountainside road in late autumn and the scenery of Busan Port in the distance unfolded. There are many things to see for both adults and children, so it would be nice to visit with family members.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Sujeong Cultural Empathy Center</p> 'Sujeong Cultural Empathy Center' is one of the remaining colonial Japanese houses in Busan and is evaluated as a place with important values ​​for research on the history of modern housing architecture and life. It was a place that gained great popularity after appearing in IU's music video in the past and has recently reopened with a newly built exhibition facility. The first floor is a library and media room, and the second floor is an exhibition space.\nWhen you enter the building, large windows, relatively high ceilings, tatami mats, and Jangji doors on the floor show a very different look from the wooden architectural style of Korea. Walking up the wooden stairs to the second floor, you can see a unique folk painting exhibition and black-and-white photos of Sujeong-dong's past.\n\nImmediately after entering, the hallway on the left is the place that appears in IU's music video. In the morning, pleasant sunlight shines in, creating a comfortable and warm atmosphere.\n\n\n"

On mountainside roads, travelers naturally follow the traces of time as they walk along steep hillsides and winding alleyways, where various monorails welcome travelers.\n\nLet me introduce you to 5 monorail spots in Busan that are popular not only for relieving traffic congestion but also for charmingphoto opportunities. So enjoy the specialness of a trip to mountainside roads, where the real story of Busan is hidden, along with a cute monorail.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">168 Stair Monorail<p>The 168 stairs along 2 Bagu Trail served as a shortcut to the mountainside road and Busan Port, and as the name suggests, the number of steps is 168. Although the slope is rather steep, the red monorail that stands out from a distance is operated free of charge, so travelers can easily climb to the top. Taking photos on the stairs before riding the monorail is a must for travelers to Bagu Trail 2. When you climb up to the monorail, you can't take your eyes off the city and the seascape that slowly unfolds.

The elevators make it easy to get to and from the stairway that looks far away, so it's reassuring. The outdoor terrace of the An Yong-bok Memorial Busan Port Opening Cultural Center across from the elevator is also a great place to enjoy a break in the city.

It is a walking trail where the gallery zone, which depicts the past of Jung-gu on the wall of the stairs next to the monorail, draws attention, and where you can visit the Park Gi-jong Memorial Hall in which you can enjoy the panoramic view of the history of Busan Railway and mountainside roads.\n\n17, Yeongju-ro, Jung-gu, Busan\nOperating Hours: 07:00-20:00\nExit 7 of Jungang station on Busan Metro Line 1 → Transfer to Bus 86 or 186 at Standard Chartered Korea bus stop → Get off at Busan Digital High School bus stop and walk for 2 minutes\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Stairs of Wishes Monorail<p> It is a monorail installed on the Stairs of Wishes that connects the mountainside road Mangyang-ro to Junganggongwon-ro above.

Thinking about what to eat means thinking about how to live in harmony with other lives. More and more people are choosing veganism as one of the closest and easiest ways for humans and nature to coexist, not simply because of the desire to satisfy one's taste buds.\nAmong vegan restaurants, I would like to introduce three restaurants with particular value for you and travel destinations that you can enjoy on foot.\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Nayuta's Kitchen<p>\"In addition to meals, our course meal includes going for a walk around the Hoedong Reservoir and experiencing nature with your whole body.\" Nayuta's Kitchen is a vegan course meal restaurant run by Nacca, a vegan chef, environmental activist, and singer-songwriter. I could feel it in her cooking, but it was confirmed when I met her in person; she is more of an artist than a chef. Her dishes harmonize season, taste, nutrition, visuals, and philosophy and are 'appreciated' not only through taste but also by the five senses.\nA course meal with a theme is prepared every month, and the theme of November's course meal is 'deep.' \"November is late autumn. Flowers fall, fruits ripen, colors and feelings of the season deepen, and people's thoughts deepen. These multilayered Deopbap/Stir-fried Ingredients with Rice express people's deep and multilayered thoughts.\"\nHer cooking, which expresses 'the harmony of nature and humans,' awakens the meaning of veganism as the aura of cooking itself. The appearance of vegetables, which were supporting roles but now transform into beautiful leads on the table, is like a small revolution and is even touching. This restaurant is recommended when you want to convey your deep feelings to your loved ones. However, do not forget that the true course is complete only when you savor the taste of walking along the Hoedong Reservoir trail.\n\n[Nayuta's Kitchen]\nOcher building, 262, Oryundae-ro, Geumjeong-gu, Busan\nInstagram@nayutas.kitchen/@nacca07\nFirst and second Friday: Vegan course cooking programs with the forest\nThird and fourth Friday: Vegan cooking classes\nApplication for the programs : linktr.ee/Nayuta_nacca\n\n\nLet's think of Nayuta's food, where every little thing is beautiful. Let's find a small one like it and take a picture so that it becomes the lead role. You don't need many supporting roles. If you try to take too many, you may end up taking nothing. It is crucial to find the 'one' that caught your attention, such as your bare feet, fallen leaves, and waves. Avoid known photo spots as much as possible. Otherwise, it would become a typical tourist photo anyone can take.\n\n※ Nearby walking tour course: Hoedong Reservoir ocher trail\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Spanish Restaurant & Gallery Printze<p>\"Printze is run by Gochi, a community of learning and practice. The basic community spirit is 'a sense of connection' with each other. I think the core of veganism is like that.\"\n\nThe Spanish restaurant Printze, located in Gupo Station Square, is famous for its localized Spanish cuisine that suits customers' tastes. Although it is a non-vegan restaurant that mainly uses seafood, menu items such as mushroom gambas, grilled vegetables, seaweed pasta, tofu mushroom pasta, and citrus fusilli salad are prepared for vegans. Georgia wine is recommended as a natural wine that goes well with these vegan dishes.\nQuality Georgian wine, rare in Busan, can be found at a reasonable price in Printze. Georgian wine, known as the world's oldest wine, is made in the traditional way by putting grape berries, leaves, and branches in a jar called a kvevri and burying them in the ground to age them. It is not easy to obtain due to the small amount coming into Korea. Georgia vegan wine has no additives such as antioxidants, so it causes less of a hangover, and the fresh purity in color, aroma, and taste is indescribably attractive.\nThe first floor of Printze is operated as a restaurant, and the second floor is a gallery and community space. It is also attracting attention as a space for cultural exchange with local residents and humanities activities for young people, centered around the gallery. Among many values, the warm hospitality of the employees and the sincere loyalty of the regular customers are especially impressive. Their unique purity and sincerity, which define the restaurant as 'a place to learn how to treat life and people,' seem to add depth and savoriness to the cooking and relationships.\n\n[Spanish Restaurant & Gallery Printze]\n2, Nakdong-daero 1694beonna-gil, Buk-gu, Busan\nInstagram@printze_spanish\nTuesday~Saturday 11:00~22:00 / Closed on Sundays and Mondays / Break time 15:00~17:00\nTuesday-Thursday Pets allowed\nlinktr.ee/printze_spanish\n\n\nIf you follow the trail that connects Gupo subway station to the Gupo Station Square, where Printze is located, you will see Golden Sunset Bridge connecting to Hwamyeong Eco Park. If you go to the other side, you will find Samnak Eco Park. These are parks where you can feel nature that is not overly artificial. The common value of veganism and community can be a 'connection that saves each other.' When you walk in the park, it would be nice to stop under a tree and be immersed in gratitude and wonder while thinking about the 'beings connected to me.' Is there any better healing than filling your stomach with good food and your mind with good thoughts?\n\nI shot it using a movie  camera. A landscape goes through a filter called emotion and is sometimes colored in emerald or mint colors. Also, isn't life often more like a movie than a movie? So let's express our vibes that flow in everyday life with the unique color of a movie film.\n\n※ Nearby walking tour courses: Samnak Riverside Park, Hwamyeong Eco Park, Golden Sunset Bridge, and Gupo Market, which are connected by the trail from Gupo subway station\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">Obuthan<p>\"Beans look similar to each other, but each has a different name and characteristic. It is important to distinguish and bring to life this unique feature. It is the same with people. Each one is as unique and individualistic as these beans.\" Jang Eun-su, CEO of the vegan restaurant 'Obuthan,' has a round and warm smile. The signature menu, 'gnocchi,' contains the feeling of that smile.\nSoft and round Gyeongdan/Sweet Rice Balls made from potatoes and Korean wheat are used instead of noodles. The soft sauce sprinkled with pistachios is flavorful, like cream. The set meals served for lunch are hearty yet light, exuding an unfamiliar sense of luxury and, at the same time, giving a familiar and friendly feeling.\nGrains are displayed on one side of the store. They have affectionate names such as Anjeunbaengi Wheat, Deungtuigi Beans, Traditional Job's Tears, and Ajukkari Chestnut Beans, and you can glimpse her concern and affection for the grains grown on our land. How can a dish made with such well-loved and understood ingredients not be harmonious?\n\n[Obuthan]\nAcross from Gosimjeongsa Temple, down Forty Stairs, 1F, 42, Donggwang-gil, Jung-gu, Busan\nInstagram@surisuri_obuthan\nTuesday and Wednesday 11:00-14:30 / Thursday, Friday, and Saturday 11:00-14:00, 18:00-21:30\nReservations and Information linktr.ee/obuthan\n\n\nObuthan is located on Forty Stairs Street in Jungang-dong. The quiet and timeless feeling unique to the old city center evokes nostalgia. Small but impactful cultural spaces such as 'Baengnyeoneo Seowon,' 'Openspace Bae,' 'Bokbyeongsan Small Art Museum,' 'Forty Stairs Cultural Center' and 'Jung-gu Cultural Center' are secretly and well hidden within a 20-minute walk centered on Obuthan. For those who like to walk, it is recommended to discover traces of affectionate life while climbing the mountainside road that leads to Choryang-dong and Yeongju-dong. It will give you a different kind of experience and inspiration to follow stray cats you sometimes can meet like in a fairy tale and get lost.\n\nThe old-fashioned atmosphere of the old city and the black-and-white photos go well together. In addition, the sculptures around Forty Stairs are interesting subjects. Look for the traces of life that move the heart while appreciating the winding scenery of the mountainside road at a slow pace.\n\n※ Nearby walking tour course: Forty Stairs, Mountainside road\n\n\n"

The reason is the ‘Gamcheon House Lights’ hanging throughout the village. Thanks to the soft lights, it hanges into a charming place to take a walk and enjoy the night view. The entire village is filled with warmth as Gamcheon House Lights run along every alleyway that retains the traditional look of old stair-style houses.\nStroll quietly along the alley.

                "ITEMCNTNTS": "It has become common to see Busan's scenery in movies or dramas. The unique scenes and atmosphere that can only be encountered in Busan, such as the sea, port, alleys, and mountainside roads, are more like a movie than a movie, and more like a drama than a drama.\n\nBusan also appears in the popular drama 'Reborn Rich' and in the movie 'Decision to Leave' directed by Park Chan-wook, who recently won the Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival. Today, we introduce Busan, which has appeared in movies and dramas like this. I hope you will be immersed in the attractions of Busan while walking around the city, like the main characters in the movies and dramas.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">‘'Reborn Rich' Jeongsimjae</p>This is probably the most talked about drama of the year. 'Reborn Rich' captivated audiences over the weekends with a viewership rating of more than 20%. The conflicts of chaebol families against the backdrop of major economic events that actually took place in Korea go right down to the wire. In particular, the charismatic performance of actor I Seong-min, who plays the role of chairman Jin Yang-cheol, the main character, makes you fall in love with the drama as the story goes deeper.\n\nThe house called 'Jeongsimjae,' where Chairman Jin Yang-cheol lives, also drew attention. This is because the elegant two-story Western-style house with a wide yard looked like a real chaebol's residence. The real building is in Busan. It is the former official residence of the Busan Mayor, located behind KBS in Namcheon-dong. With over 20,000 trees planted, it feels more like an arboretum than a house. Standing on the observatory on one side of the garden, you can see Haeundae Marine City and Gwangandaegyo Bridge.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">‘Decision to Leave’ Chowon Apartment</p>Director Park Chan-wook's film 'Decision to Leave,' which won the Best Director Award at the 75th Cannes Film Festival, was filmed mainly in Busan. There are so many places in the movie that it's hard to list them all. Among them, the numerous stairs and narrow alleys that appeared in the chase scene drew the audience's attention because of the unique scenery that can only be found in Busan. It is Choryang 2 Bagu Trail that is now known to many travelers. It is a place where the culture of the mountainside road, which was naturally created as many refugees flocked to Busan during the Korean War, remains intact.\n\nThe highlight of the chase scene was around Chowon Apartment, which is between Choryang 2 Bagu Trail and Mangyang-ro. It consists of a long, exhausting stairway, an alleyway with murals, and even a rooftop where a detective eventually arrests a suspect. It was a scene that was only possible because it was filmed in Busan. It is one of Busan’s treasures. You can see a panoramic view of the city from the rooftop and rare sights such as cars parked on roofs.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">‘Pachinko’ Taejongdae Park</p> The Apple TV original drama 'Pachinko' vividly depicted turbulent times through the story of four generations of Korean families in Japan. As Busan was the hometown of the main character, 'Seon-ja,' various parts of the city appeared in the drama. The hometown of Seon-ja, which appeared in the drama's first episode, is Taejongdae Park in Yeongdo. The place where the young Seon-ja worked was Taewon Pebble Beach in Taejongdae Park. It is a location where pebble fields, rock walls, dense forest, and blue sea are in harmony, and many tourists still visit.\n\nWhen Seon-ja, after becoming a grandmother, returns to her hometown with her son, they run to Gamjihaebyeon Beach. It is a scene full of longing for one’s hometown. The seaside village depicted in the scene is famous for its grilled clams and is a favorite place for Busan residents because they can eat fresh seafood while listening to the sound of waves.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"font-size28 colorDarkBlue medium\">‘Curtain Call’ Jukseong Dream Filming Set</p>'Curtain Call,' which tells a story about a secret play for a terminally ill grandmother's happy life, is also a popular drama these days. There is a scene where Se-yeon (Ha Ji-won), who appears as the granddaughter of the main character, Ja Geum-sun (Go Doo-shim), takes her half-cousin (Kang Ha-neul) to a private studio. The exotic building standing against the blue sea is very impressive. It is Jukseong Dream Catholic Church in Gijang.\n\nIt was a set made to film the 2009 drama 'Dream,' but the Catholic church standing on the coastal cliff is so pretty that tourists fallen in love with it ever since it was built. The morning scenery with the red sun rising behind the romantic church is like a scene from a melodrama. On clear, cloudless nights, you can see the twinkling stars, so it is Gijang's representative attraction visited by tourists day and night.\n\n\n"
